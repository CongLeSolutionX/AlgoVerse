The Fast & Slow Pointers algorithm, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a technique used to solve problems involving cycles in data structures. It involves two pointers that move at different speeds through the data.

## Usage:
- **Data Structures Involved:** Array, String, Linked List
- **Main Purpose:** Detect cycles or find specific elements within a structure.

## How It Works:
1. **Two Pointers:** 
   - **Slow Pointer (Tortoise):** Moves one step at a time.
   - **Fast Pointer (Hare):** Moves two steps at a time.
   
2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer within the cycle.
   - If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the data structure.

3. **Cycle Start Detection:**
   - Once a cycle is detected (pointers meet), reset one pointer to the start and move both one step at a time to find the cycle's starting node.

## Sample Problems:
- **Middle of the Linked List:** Find the middle by moving slow one step and fast two steps.
- **Happy Number:** Determine if following the square sum of digits leads to 1 (a cycle indicates a non-happy number).
- **Cycle in a Circular Array:** Detect repetitive movements in circular data arrangements.

This algorithm is efficient because it uses constant space and can detect cycles in linear time.

## Full code implementation of the algorithm in Swift

Here's a Swift implementation of the Fast & Slow Pointers algorithm to detect a cycle and find the cycle's starting point in a linked list:

```swift
class ListNode {
    var value: Int
    var next: ListNode?

    init(_ value: Int) {
        self.value = value
        self.next = nil
    }
}

func detectCycle(_ head: ListNode?) -> ListNode? {
    var slow = head
    var fast = head

    // Detect if a cycle exists
    while fast != nil && fast?.next != nil {
        slow = slow?.next
        fast = fast?.next?.next

        if slow === fast {
            // A cycle is detected, now find the start of the cycle
            var startPointer = head

            while startPointer !== slow {
                startPointer = startPointer?.next
                slow = slow?.next
            }

            return startPointer // Cycle start found
        }
    }

    return nil // No cycle
}

// Example usage:
let head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next?.next = ListNode(3)
head.next?.next?.next = ListNode(4)
head.next?.next?.next?.next = ListNode(5)
head.next?.next?.next?.next?.next = head.next?.next  // Creates a cycle

if let cycleStart = detectCycle(head) {
    print("Cycle starts at node with value: \(cycleStart.value)")
} else {
    print("No cycle detected")
}
```

## Explanation:
- **ListNode Class**: Represents a node in the linked list.
- **detectCycle Function**:
  - Uses two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
  - Moves `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps until they meet, indicating a cycle.
  - Resets one pointer to the head and moves both by one step to find the cycle's start node.
- **Example Usage**: The list is created, a cycle is introduced, and the function checks for the cycle's presence and starting point.

## Iterate all the case and print out all the cases from the algorithm


Hereâ€™s how you can extend the algorithm to iterate through the linked list, detect, and print out all cases related to cycle detection, such as when a cycle is detected and where it starts:

```swift
class ListNode {
    var value: Int
    var next: ListNode?

    init(_ value: Int) {
        self.value = value
        self.next = nil
    }
}

func detectCycle(_ head: ListNode?) -> (hasCycle: Bool, cycleStart: ListNode?) {
    var slow = head
    var fast = head

    while fast != nil && fast?.next != nil {
        slow = slow?.next
        fast = fast?.next?.next

        if slow === fast {
            // Cycle detected
            print("Cycle detected")
            var startPointer = head

            while startPointer !== slow {
                startPointer = startPointer?.next
                slow = slow?.next
            }

            // Cycle start found
            print("Cycle starts at node with value: \(startPointer?.value ?? -1)")
            return (true, startPointer)
        }
    }

    // No cycle found
    print("No cycle detected")
    return (false, nil)
}

// Example usage:
let head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next?.next = ListNode(3)
head.next?.next?.next = ListNode(4)
head.next?.next?.next?.next = ListNode(5)
head.next?.next?.next?.next?.next = head.next?.next  // Creates a cycle

let result = detectCycle(head)
if result.hasCycle {
    print("Cycle starts at node with value: \(result.cycleStart?.value ?? -1)")
} else {
    print("No cycle detected")
}
```

## Explanation:

- **Cycle Detection**: As the fast and slow pointers move, if they meet, it indicates a cycle.
- **Cycle Start Detection**: Reset one pointer to the head and move both by one step until they meet again, which identifies the cycle's start node.
- **Output**: Prints whether a cycle is detected and the value at the node where the cycle starts.

This code will print each situation as it goes through the list, giving a clear picture of where cycles are detected and where they start.

## Iterate all the cases and print out all the cases from the algorithm


Let's create a detailed example of using the Fast & Slow Pointers algorithm with multiple test cases, checking for different scenarios.

## Detailed Example

```swift
class ListNode {
    var value: Int
    var next: ListNode?

    init(_ value: Int) {
        self.value = value
        self.next = nil
    }
}

func detectCycle(_ head: ListNode?) -> (hasCycle: Bool, cycleStart: ListNode?) {
    var slow = head
    var fast = head

    while fast != nil && fast?.next != nil {
        slow = slow?.next
        fast = fast?.next?.next

        if slow === fast {
            print("Cycle detected")
            var startPointer = head

            while startPointer !== slow {
                startPointer = startPointer?.next
                slow = slow?.next
            }

            print("Cycle starts at node with value: \(startPointer?.value ?? -1)")
            return (true, startPointer)
        }
    }

    print("No cycle detected")
    return (false, nil)
}

func testCycleDetection() {
    // Test Case 1: List with a cycle
    let head1 = ListNode(1)
    head1.next = ListNode(2)
    head1.next?.next = ListNode(3)
    head1.next?.next?.next = ListNode(4)
    head1.next?.next?.next?.next = ListNode(5)
    head1.next?.next?.next?.next?.next = head1.next?.next // Creates a cycle at node 3

    print("Test Case 1:")
    _ = detectCycle(head1)

    // Test Case 2: List without a cycle
    let head2 = ListNode(1)
    head2.next = ListNode(2)
    head2.next?.next = ListNode(3)

    print("\nTest Case 2:")
    _ = detectCycle(head2)

    // Test Case 3: Single node, no cycle
    let head3 = ListNode(1)

    print("\nTest Case 3:")
    _ = detectCycle(head3)

    // Test Case 4: Single node, self-cycle
    let head4 = ListNode(1)
    head4.next = head4 // Creates a cycle with itself

    print("\nTest Case 4:")
    _ = detectCycle(head4)
}

// Run test cases
testCycleDetection()
```

## Explanation

- **Test Case 1**: A list with a cycle starting at node 3. The algorithm detects the cycle and identifies the start.
- **Test Case 2**: A simple list without a cycle. The algorithm confirms no cycle.
- **Test Case 3**: A single node with no cycle. The algorithm handles this edge case.
- **Test Case 4**: A single node that points to itself, forming a cycle. The algorithm detects the self-cycle.

Each test case prints the result, showing whether a cycle is detected and where it starts, if applicable.
