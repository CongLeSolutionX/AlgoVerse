### Explanation of Sorting Connections in Descending Order (TSCL)


The `Sorting Connections in Descending Order` step takes the Torque Sorted Connection List (TSCL) as input, which is a list of connections. Each connection in the list is associated with a torque value (ùúèùúèùëñùëñ).  The algorithm sorts these connections based on these torque values, placing the connection with the highest torque value at the beginning of the list, followed by those with progressively lower torque values.  This process is crucial for identifying abnormal connections in the later stages of the algorithm.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Input:** The input is a list of connections (each with a corresponding torque value), represented as `TSCL`.

2. **Sort Connections:** The algorithm sorts the connections in the `TSCL` list in descending order based on their torque values. This step involves iterating through the `TSCL`:

   *   For each connection in the `TSCL`, compare its torque value (ùúèùúèùëñùëñ) with the torque value of the previous connection in the sorted list.
   *   If the current connection's torque is greater than the previous one's, swap their positions in the list to maintain the descending order.
   *   This comparison and swapping operation is repeated until the entire `TSCL` is fully sorted in descending order.

3. **Output:** The output of this step is the sorted `TSCL` list, where connections with higher torque values appear at the beginning of the list.  This ordered list is essential for the subsequent steps of the algorithm, enabling identification of abnormal connections and noise.

### Key Considerations

*   **Efficiency:**  The sorting algorithm should be efficient (e.g., merge sort or quick sort) to minimize the computational cost of this step, especially for large datasets.
*   **Torque Values:** The torque values (ùúèùúèùëñùëñ) are used as the primary criterion for sorting.
*   **Order Matters:** The order in which the connections are sorted in the `TSCL` list is critical for the next stage of the algorithm (identifying abnormal connections).



This description, combined with the Mermaid diagram, should provide a clear picture of the `Sorting Connections in Descending Order` process.  Remember that `TSCL` is just a list or array containing the connections and their corresponding torque values.
