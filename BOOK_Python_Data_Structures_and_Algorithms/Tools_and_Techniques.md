**Key improvements and Explanations:**

*   **Data Cleaning Subgraph:** Added a subgraph for "Data Cleaning" to address the initial state of raw data, expanding on the "Handling Missing Data" concept.
*   **Feature Engineering Subgraph:** Added a "Feature Engineering" section that includes:
    *   More detailed Scaling methods: Min-Max Scaling, Standard Scaling
    *   Feature Selection: Dimensionality Reduction, Correlation Analysis
*   **Data Representation Subgraph:**  More chart types are included.
*   **Text Preprocessing** Given the book's content, particularly the Machine Learning chapter, a "Text Preprocessing" section is added, highlighting:
    *   Tokenization
    *   Stop Word Removal
    *   Stemming/Lemmatization
*   **Connections:** Increased the number of connections between nodes to better reflect relationships (e.g., Data Visualization is connected to multiple Chart types).
*    **Annotations:** Use more descriptive annotations for each technique.
*   **Styling:** Consistent styling for clarity.

This expanded diagram provides a more detailed and interconnected overview of the various tools and techniques discussed in the book.
