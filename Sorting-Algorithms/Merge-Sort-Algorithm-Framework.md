## **Keywords:**
- **Merge Sort Algorithm**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**
- **Recursive Algorithm**
- **Non-Recursive Implementation**
- **In-Place Sorting**
- **Stable Sorting**
- **Big O Notation**
- **Algorithm Optimization**

## **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental aspects of the Merge Sort algorithm, its implementation, and its performance characteristics.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Merge Sort, Divide and Conquer, Time Complexity, Space Complexity
- **Resources:** Textbooks on algorithms (e.g., *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al.), academic papers, reputable online resources (e.g., [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**

Merge Sort's time complexity recurrence relation:

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
O(1), & \text{if } n \leq 1 \\
2T\left(\dfrac{n}{2}\right) + O(n), & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
$$

- **Solution to Recurrence:**

Using the Master Theorem, the solution is:

$$
T(n) = O(n \log n)
$$

## **Step 2: Analyze the Merge Sort Algorithm**

**Objective:** Break down the Merge Sort algorithm and understand how its components contribute to the overall performance.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Recursive Algorithm, Divide and Conquer, Merge Function, Base Case
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Divide Step:** Splitting the array into two halves.
  - **Conquer Step:** Recursively sorting each half.
  - **Combine Step:** Merging the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Recurrence Relation:**

The time complexity is given by:

$$
T(n) = 2T\left(\dfrac{n}{2}\right) + cn
$$

Where:
- $T(n)$ = Time to sort an array of size $n$
- $c n$ = Time to merge two arrays of size $\dfrac{n}{2}$

- **Base Case:** For $n \leq 1$, the array is already sorted, so:

$$
T(1) = O(1)
$$

## **Step 3: Analyze Space Complexity**

**Objective:** Understand the space requirements of Merge Sort and explore in-place merge sort variations.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Space Complexity, Auxiliary Space, In-place Algorithm
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Standard Merge Sort:** Requires $O(n)$ auxiliary space for merging.
  - **In-place Variations:** Aim to reduce space usage, potentially at the cost of increased time complexity.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Space Complexity:**

- Auxiliary space: $O(n)$ for temporary arrays during merging.
- Stack space due to recursion: $O(\log n)$ (depth of recursion tree).

- **Total Space Complexity:**

$$
S(n) = O(n)
$$

## **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:** Derive and understand the time and space complexity equations mathematically.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity Derivation, Master Theorem, Big O Notation
- **Tasks:**
  - **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**

Using the Master Theorem for divide and conquer recurrences:

For $T(n) = a T\left(\dfrac{n}{b}\right) + f(n)$:

- $a = 2$ (number of subproblems)
- $b = 2$ (subproblem size)
- $f(n) = c n$

Calculate $\log_b a = \log_2 2 = 1$

- Since $f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a} \log^k n)$ with $k = 0$.

- Therefore, by Case 2 of the Master Theorem:

$$
T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)
$$

**Mathematical Focus:**

- **Detailed Recurrence Solution:**

Using recursion tree method or Master Theorem:

At each level of recursion, total work is $O(n)$.

There are $\log n$ levels of recursion (since the array size halves each time).

So total time is:

$$
T(n) = O(n \log n)
$$

## **Step 5: Compare Merge Sort with Other Sorting Algorithms**

  - **Space Complexity:**
    - **Merge Sort:** $O(n)$ auxiliary space
    - **Quick Sort:** $O(\log n)$ space due to recursion
    - **Heap Sort:** $O(1)$ auxiliary space
  - **Stability:**
    - **Merge Sort:** Stable
    - **Quick Sort:** Not stable

T(n) = \begin{cases}
O(1), & \text{if } n \leq 1 \\
