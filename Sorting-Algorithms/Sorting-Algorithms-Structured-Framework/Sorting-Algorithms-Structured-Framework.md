# **Example Mathematical Equations and Syntax**

## **Time Complexity Notations:**

- **Big O Notation:**
$$
T(n) = O(f(n))
$$
Indicates that the time complexity grows at most as fast as $f(n)$.

- **Omega Notation:**
$$
T(n) = \Omega(f(n))
$$
Indicates that the time complexity grows at least as fast as $f(n)$.

- **Theta Notation:**
$$
T(n) = \Theta(f(n))
$$
Indicates that the time complexity grows exactly as fast as $f(n)$.

## **Master Theorem for Solving Recurrences:**

For recurrences of the form:
$$
T(n) = a \cdot T\left( \frac{n}{b} \right) + f(n)
$$
- **Case 1:** If $f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, then:
$$
T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})
$$

- **Case 2:** If $f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \cdot \log^k n)$ for some $k \geq 0$, then:
$$
T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \cdot \log^{k+1} n)
$$

- **Case 3:** If $f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, and if $a \cdot f\left( \frac{n}{b} \right) \leq c \cdot f(n)$ for some constant $c < 1$, then:
$$
T(n) = \Theta(f(n))
$$

## **Recurrence Relations Examples:**

- **Merge Sort:**
$$
T(n) = 2 \cdot T\left( \frac{n}{2} \right) + O(n)
$$

- **Quick Sort (Worst Case):**
