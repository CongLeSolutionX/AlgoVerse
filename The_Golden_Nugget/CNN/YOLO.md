## Overview

**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The key innovation of YOLO is the unified architecture that enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while maintaining high average precision.

- **Purpose**: Detect and classify multiple objects within an image in a single forward pass through the network.
- **Applications**:
  - **Real-time Object Detection**: Videos, autonomous driving, surveillance systems.
  - **Robotics**: Enabling robots to understand their environment.
  - **Industrial Automation**: Quality control, defect detection.

---

## **Key Concepts**

### **1. Unified Detection**

YOLO models frame object detection as a **single regression problem**, directly from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities.

- **Single Neural Network**: Processes the entire image at once.
- **Global Reasoning**: Incorporates contextual information.

### **2. Gridding the Image**

- **Input Image**: Divided into an \( S \times S \) grid of cells.
- **Each Cell**:
  - Predicts **B** bounding boxes.
  - Provides **confidence scores** for those boxes.
  - Predicts **C** class probabilities.

---

```

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the image.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Predict bounding boxes and class probabilities.

### **Detailed Architecture (YOLOv1)**

1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - Series of convolutional and pooling layers.
   - Feature extraction.

2. **Flattening**:
   - Output from convolutional layers flattened into a vector.

3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Two fully connected layers.
   - Output layer predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities.

        C --> D[Fully Connected Layers]
        D --> E["Output Tensor SxSx(Bx5 + C)"]
    end
    
```


- **Output Tensor**:
  - Size: \( S \times S \times (B \times 5 + C) \)
  - **S**: Grid size (e.g., 7)
  - **B**: Number of bounding boxes per cell (e.g., 2)
  - **C**: Number of classes (e.g., 20 for PASCAL VOC)

---

## **Processing Pipeline**

1. **Image Division**:
   - Divide the input image into a grid.
   
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       Image[Input Image] -->|Divide| Grid[SxS Grid]
   ```

2. **Bounding Box Prediction**:
   - Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes.
   - Each bounding box includes:
     - \( x \), \( y \): Center coordinates relative to the grid cell.
     - \( w \), \( h \): Width and height relative to the whole image.
     - \( \text{Confidence} \): Probability that a bounding box contains an object and how accurate it is.

3. **Class Probability Prediction**:
   - Each cell predicts class probabilities \( P(Class_i | Object) \).

4. **Confidence Scores**:
   - For each bounding box:
     
     $$
     \text{Confidence} = P(\text{Object}) \times \text{IOU}_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}
     $$

     - \( P(\text{Object}) \): Probability that an object exists in that grid cell.
     - \( \text{IOU}_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}} \): Intersection over Union between predicted box and ground truth.

---

## **Mathematical Formulation**

### **Bounding Box Prediction**

- Each bounding box prediction includes:
  - $x, y, w, h, \text{Confidence}s$.

- **Center Coordinates (\( x, y \))**:
  - Relative to the bounds of the grid cell.
  - Values between 0 and 1.

- **Width and Height (\( w, h \))**:
  - Relative to the entire image width and height.
  - Values normalized between 0 and 1 but can be greater than 1.

### **Class Probability Map**

- For each cell:
  - Predicts \( C \) conditional class probabilities.

- **Class-Specific Confidence Score**:

  $$
  \text{Score}_{ij}^{\text{Class}} = P(\text{Object}) \times P(\text{Class} | \text{Object}) \times \text{IOU}_{\text{pred}}^{\text{truth}}
  $$

### **Loss Function**

YOLO uses a specialized loss function to directly optimize detection performance.

**Total Loss (\( \mathcal{L} \))**:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \lambda_{\text{coord}} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} \mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}} \left[ (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2 + (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + (w_i - \hat{w}_i)^2 + (h_i - \hat{h}_i)^2 \right] + \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} \mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}} (C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2 + \lambda_{\text{noobj}} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} \mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{noobj}} (C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2 + \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \mathbf{1}_i^{\text{obj}} \sum_{c \in \text{classes}} (p_i(c) - \hat{p}_i(c))^2
$$

Where:

- **Variables**:
  - \( S \): Grid size.
  - \( B \): Number of bounding boxes per grid cell.
  - \( C \): Number of classes.
  - $\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}$: Indicator function that equals 1 if object exists in cell $i$ for bounding box $j$, 0 otherwise.
  - $\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{noobj}} = 1 - \mathbf{1}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}$.

- **Components**:
  - **Localization Loss**: Errors in predicted bounding box coordinates.
    - Weighted by $\lambda_{\text{coord}}$ (e.g., 5).
  - **Confidence Loss Object**: Confidence score errors when an object is present.
  - **Confidence Loss No Object**: Confidence score errors when no object is present.
    - Weighted by $\lambda_{\text{noobj}}$ (e.g., 0.5).
  - **Classification Loss**: Errors in class probabilities.

## **Mathematical Details**

### **Intersection over Union (IoU)**

- **Definition**:

  $$
  \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}
  $$

- **Usage**:

  - Keeps bounding boxes with the highest confidence scores.

- **Process**:
  1. Sort all predicted boxes by confidence score.
  2. Select the box with the highest score and suppress all boxes with IoU greater than a threshold (e.g., 0.5).
  3. Repeat with the next highest score.

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Anchor Boxes**

- **Concept**:
  - Predefined bounding box shapes and sizes.
  - Helps capture objects with varying aspect ratios.

- **Effect on Predictions**:
  - Network predicts offsets to these anchor boxes rather than predicting absolute bounding box coordinates.

### **Activation Functions**

- **Leaky ReLU**:

  $$
  f(x) = \begin{cases}
  x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  0.01x & \text{if } x \leq 0
  \end{cases}
  $$

- **Usage**: Allows a small gradient when the unit is not active, improving gradient flow.
