## Overview

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a class of deep learning neural networks widely used for analyzing visual imagery. They are specifically designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images, by employing a mathematical operation called **convolution**.

- **Purpose**: To automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.
- **Applications**:
  - **Image Classification**: Assigning a label to an image (e.g., cat, dog).
  - **Facial Recognition**: Identifying or verifying a person from a digital image.
  - **Object Detection**: Detecting instances of objects within images.
  - **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into meaningful parts.

## **CNN Architecture**

A typical CNN architecture consists of a series of layers that transform the input image into outputs such as class probabilities. The main types of layers in a CNN are:

1. **Convolutional Layers**
2. **Pooling Layers**
3. **Activation Functions**
4. **Fully Connected Layers**

### **High-Level Architecture**

```

## **Detailed Components**

### **1. Convolutional Layers**

- **Function**: Performs convolution operations to extract features from the input image.
- **Process**:
  - Applies a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input.
  - Each filter convolves across the width and height of the input image, producing a 2D activation map (**feature map**).
  - Captures local dependencies using receptive fields.

**Mathematical Representation**:

$$
\text{Output}(i,j) = (X * W)(i,j) + b
$$

Where:
- $X$ = Input image or feature map.
- $W$ = Filter weights (kernel).
- $*$ = Convolution operation.
- $b$ = Bias term.

**Visualization of Convolution**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Convolution Operation
	    InputImage["Input Image <br> (Pixels)"] -->|Convolve| Kernel["Filter <br>(Weights)"]
	    Kernel --> FeatureMap[Feature Map]
    end
    
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Stride**: The number of pixels by which the filter slides over the input.
- **Padding**: Adding zeros around the input image borders to control the spatial size of the output.
- **Number of Filters**: Determines the depth of the output feature map.

### **2. Activation Functions**

- **Purpose**: Introduce non-linearity into the network.
- **Common Functions**:
  - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**:
  
    $$
    \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
    $$
  
  - **Others**: Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU.

**Effect of ReLU Activation**:

    style OutputY fill:#b1bf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### **3. Pooling Layers**

- **Function**: Reduce the spatial size of the feature maps to decrease computational load and control overfitting.
- **Types**:
  - **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value from the region covered by the filter.
  - **Average Pooling**: Takes the average value.

**Pooling Operation**:

```

**Mathematical Representation for Max Pooling**:

$$
\text{Output}(i,j) = \max_{(m,n) \in \text{Region}} \text{Input}(m,n)
$$

### **4. Fully Connected Layers**

- **Purpose**: Perform high-level reasoning and classification based on the features extracted.
- **Process**:
  - Flatten the multidimensional tensor output from the previous layers into a vector.
  - Apply linear transformations and activation functions.

**Fully Connected Layer Connectivity**:

## **Feature Extraction and Learning**

### **Local Connectivity and Receptive Fields**

- **Local Connectivity**: Each neuron in the convolutional layer is connected only to a local region of the input.
- **Receptive Field**: The local region of the input that affects a particular feature in the output.

**Illustration of Receptive Field**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Input Image
    A1(Pixel)
    A2(Pixel)
    A3(Pixel)
    A4(Pixel)
    end
    subgraph Feature Map
    B1(Feature)
    end
    A1 --> B1
    A2 --> B1
    A3 --> B1
    A4 --> B1
```

### **Hierarchical Feature Learning**

- **Lower Layers**: Learn simple features like edges and textures.
- **Higher Layers**: Combine lower-level features to detect more complex patterns like shapes or objects.

## **Training CNNs**

### **Cost Function and Optimization**

- **Loss Function**: Measures the discrepancy between the predicted output and the true label.
  - **Common Loss Functions**:
    - **Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification:

      $$
      L = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
      $$

- **Optimization Algorithm**: Adjusts the parameters to minimize the loss function.
  - **Gradient Descent Variants**: SGD, Adam, RMSProp.

### **Backpropagation**

- **Purpose**: Computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters.
- **Process**:
  - Propagate the error backward through the network.
  - Update weights using the gradients and learning rate.

**Backpropagation Flow**:

```mermaid

    Loss --> FC[Fully Connected Layers]
    FC --> Pool2[Pooling Layer 2]
    Pool2 --> Conv2[Convolutional Layer 2]
    Conv2 --> Pool1[Pooling Layer 1]
    Pool1 --> Conv1[Convolutional Layer 1]
```

## **Advanced Concepts and Practices**

### **Regularization Techniques**

- **Purpose**: Prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Methods**:

    graph TD
        InputUnits[Input Units] -->|Dropout Layer| OutputUnits[Output Units]
        style OutputUnits stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    ```
  
  - **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes the inputs of each layer to stabilize learning.

    $$
    \text{BN}(x) = \gamma \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} \right) + \beta
    $$
