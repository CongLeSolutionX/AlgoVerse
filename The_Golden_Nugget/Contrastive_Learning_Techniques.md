Contrastive Learning is a self-supervised learning paradigm that has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The core idea revolves around learning representations by contrasting positive and negative pairs of data. This approach enhances the quality of embeddings, ensuring that similar inputs have similar representations while dissimilar ones are distinct. Below are detailed explanations and accompanying Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the complexities and technical concepts of Contrastive Learning Techniques.

  look: handDrawn
  theme: dark
---
graph TD
    A[Embeddings of Positive Pairs] --> B[Compute Distance]
    A --> C[Loss Calculation]

$$

Where:
- $D_i$ = Distance between embeddings.
- $y_i$ = Label indicating positive pair (1) or negative pair (0).
- $m$ = Margin parameter.

### 3.2. Triplet Loss

**Mathematical Representation:**

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max \left( 0, D(a_i, p_i) - D(a_i, n_i) + \alpha \right)
$$

Where:
