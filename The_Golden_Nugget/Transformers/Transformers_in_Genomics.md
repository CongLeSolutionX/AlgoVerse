## Overview of Transformers in Genomics

### Purpose

- **Transformers** are powerful neural network architectures that can model long-range dependencies in sequential data.
- In genomics, they are used for **sequence analysis**, which involves understanding and interpreting DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.
- Transformers capture complex patterns in genomic sequences, aiding in tasks like **gene prediction**, **variant detection**, **functional annotation**, and **epigenetic profiling**.

### Applications

- **DNA Sequence Modeling**: Predicting functional regions, transcription factor binding sites, and regulatory elements.
- **RNA Analysis**: Splicing prediction, RNA-binding protein interaction modeling.
- **Protein Sequence Analysis**: Predicting protein structure and function.
- **Variant Effect Prediction**: Assessing the impact of genetic variants on gene function.
- **Epigenomics**: Modeling histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns.

---

## Challenges in Genomic Sequence Analysis

- **High Dimensionality**: Genomic sequences are extremely long (human genome ~3 billion base pairs).
- **Complex Dependencies**: Regulatory elements can be far apart, requiring models to capture long-range interactions.
- **Limited Data**: Labeled data is often scarce due to experimental limitations.
- **Class Imbalance**: Functional elements make up a small fraction of the genome.
- **Sequential Nature**: Traditional models like CNNs have limitations in capturing sequential dependencies over long distances.

## Transformer Architecture for Genomics

### Adapting Transformers to Genomic Sequences

- **Input Representation**: Genomic sequences are converted into numerical representations suitable for model input.
- **Sequence Tokenization**: Sequences are split into k-mers (subsequences of length k) to create tokens.
- **Positional Encoding**: Positional information is crucial as the order of nucleotides determines function.

    Positional_Encoding --> Transformer_Encoder

```

- **Input**: Raw nucleotide sequences (e.g., A, C, G, T).
- **Tokenization**: Dividing the sequence into overlapping k-mers.
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts k-mer tokens into continuous vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to embeddings.
- **Transformer Encoder**: Captures dependencies and patterns.
- **Output**: Task-specific outputs (e.g., classification, regression).

    end
    E1 --> E2 --> E3 --> E4 --> E5
    E5 --> E6
    E6 --> Output[Task-Specific Head]
```

- **Encoder Only**: Most genomic tasks use only the encoder part since the goal is to extract representations from sequences.

---

## Components Specific to Genomics

### 1. Input Representation

- **Nucleotide Encoding**: Representing nucleotides (A, C, G, T) numerically.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Each nucleotide is represented as a one-hot vector.
  
$$
  \text{A} = [1, 0, 0, 0], \quad \text{C} = [0, 1, 0, 0], \quad \text{G} = [0, 0, 1, 0], \quad \text{T} = [0, 0, 0, 1]
$$
  
- **K-mer Tokenization**: Sequences are split into overlapping k-length substrings.

  Example for k=3 (3-mers):

  ```
  Sequence: ACGTAC
  3-mers: [ACG, CGT, GTA, TAC]
  ```

### 2. Positional Encoding

- Since the order of nucleotides is critical, positional encoding is essential.

- **Learned Positional Embeddings**: Instead of fixed sinusoidal functions, learnable embeddings are often used.

### 3. Self-Attention in Genomics

- **Capturing Long-Range Dependencies**: Self-attention allows the model to consider interactions between distant nucleotides.

### 4. Task-Specific Output Heads

- **Classification Head**: For tasks like promoter prediction, enhancer identification.

- **Regression Head**: For tasks like predicting expression levels.

---

## Self-Attention Mechanism in Genomics

### Purpose

- To model interactions between nucleotides or k-mers across the entire sequence.

### Process

1. **Compute Q, K, V**: From input embeddings of k-mers.

2. **Compute Attention Scores**: Determine the relevance of each k-mer to every other k-mer.

3. **Apply Softmax**: Generate attention weights.

4. **Weighted Sum**: Aggregate information focusing on important positions.

    Weighted_Sum --> Output[Contextual Representations]
```

### Attention Computation

Given input embeddings \( X \):

1. Compute Queries, Keys, and Values:

$$
  Q = X W^Q, \quad K = X W^K, \quad V = X W^V
$$

2. Scaled Dot-Product Attention:

$$
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
$$
