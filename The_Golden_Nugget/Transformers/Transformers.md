## Overview of Transformers

### Purpose

- **Transformers** are neural network models designed to handle sequential data.
- They learn **context** and **meaning** by capturing relationships between all elements in a sequence.
- They use a mechanism called **self-attention** to weigh the significance of each part of the input data.

### Applications

- They power **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as:
  - **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
  - **Claude**
  - **LLaMA**
- These models can understand and generate human-like text, translate languages, summarize text, and more.

## Transformer Architecture

The Transformer architecture was introduced in the paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It relies entirely on **attention mechanisms** to draw global dependencies between input and output.

### High-Level Architecture

The Transformer consists of an **Encoder** and a **Decoder** stack.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Input --> EncoderStack
    EncoderStack --> DecoderStack
    DecoderStack --> Output
```

- **Input**: Sequence of tokens (words, subwords).
- **Encoder Stack**: Processes the input sequence to generate encodings that contain information about which parts of the inputs are relevant to each other.
- **Decoder Stack**: Uses the encoder's outputs along with its own inputs to generate the output sequence.
- **Output**: Generated sequence, such as translated text.

- **Encoder Layer**:
  - **Input Embedding + Positional Encoding**: Converts input tokens into vectors and adds positional information.
  - **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different positions.
  - **Add & Norm**: Residual connection followed by layer normalization.
  - **Feed-Forward**: Applies a fully connected feed-forward network.
- **Decoder Layer**:
  - **Output Embedding + Positional Encoding**: Similar to the encoder's input embedding.
  - **Masked Multi-Head Attention**: Prevents positions from attending to subsequent positions (future tokens).
  - **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Allows the decoder to focus on appropriate places in the input sequence.
  - **Linear + Softmax**: Generates probabilities over the output vocabulary.

## Components of the Transformer

### 1. Embedding Layer

- Converts discrete tokens into continuous vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding** is added to embeddings to incorporate sequence order.

**Positional Encoding Equations:**

$$
\begin{align*}
PE_{(pos, 2i)} &= \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right) \\
PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} &= \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

- $pos$: Position in the sequence.
- $i$: Dimension index.
- $d_{model}$: Model dimension.

### 2. Multi-Head Attention

Allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Input --> Linear_QKV["Linear Layers (Q,K,V)"] --> Split_Heads
    Split_Heads --> Attention_Heads
    Attention_Heads --> Concatenate
    Concatenate --> Linear_Output
    Linear_Output --> Output
    
```

- **Q (Queries)**, **K (Keys)**, **V (Values)**: Computed from the input.
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
$$

  - $d_k$: Dimension of the key vectors.

### 3. Feed-Forward Network (FFN)

- Applies two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
- Operates separately and identically on each position.

---

## Self-Attention Mechanism

### Purpose

- To compute a representation of the input sequence where each token incorporates information from the entire sequence.

### Process

1. **Compute Q, K, V**:
   - Apply linear transformations to the input embeddings to obtain queries $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$.

2. **Compute Attention Scores**:
   - Multiply $Q$ and $K^\top$, scale by $\sqrt{d_k}$.

3. **Apply Softmax**:
   - Normalize the scores to get the attention weights.

4. **Compute Weighted Sum**:
   - Multiply the attention weights by $V$ to get the output.

    Softmax --> Weighted_Sum[Compute Weighted Sum with V]
    Weighted_Sum --> Output
```

## Multi-Head Attention

- **Multiple Attention Heads** allow the model to focus on different positions and aspects of the sequence.

**Equation for Multi-Head Attention:**

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h) W^O
$$

- $\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(Q W_i^Q, K W_i^K, V W_i^V)$
- $W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V$: Parameter matrices for the $i$-th head.
- $W^O$: Output weight matrix.

## Complexities and Technical Concepts

### Computational Complexity

- **Self-Attention Complexity**:

  - **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ due to the attention matrix.

- **Scaling Challenges**:

  - As sequence length increases, computation becomes expensive.
  - Solutions include efficient attention mechanisms (e.g., sparse attention, approximations).

### Optimization Techniques

## Technical Deep Dive

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

- Computes attention weights based on the dot product of query and key vectors.
- Scaling by $\sqrt{d_k}$ prevents the dot products from growing too large.

### Residual Connections and Layer Normalization

- **Residual Connections**:

  - Helps with training deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.
  - The output of each sub-layer is added to its input:  $\text{Layer Output} = \text{Sub-layer Output} + \text{Input}$

- **Layer Normalization**:

  - Normalizes the inputs across the feature dimension.
  - Improves training stability and convergence.

### Position-Wise Feed-Forward Networks

- Applied independently to each position.
- Consists of two linear transformations with an activation function in between.

### Masking

- **Padding Mask**:

  - Masks out the padding tokens in the sequence to prevent the model from attending to them.

- **Look-Ahead Mask (Causal Mask)**:

  - Used in the decoder to prevent the model from attending to future positions.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Self-Attention Computation

Given input matrix $X$:

1. Compute Queries, Keys, and Values:

$$
 Q = X W^Q, \quad K = X W^K, \quad V = X W^V
$$

   - $W^Q, W^K, W^V$: Learnable weight matrices.

2. Compute Scaled Dot-Product Attention:

$$
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \text{Mask} \right) V
$$

   - **Mask**: Adds $-\infty$ (or a very large negative number) to masked positions before softmax.

### Output Generation

- The decoder produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each position in the output sequence.
- The model selects the token with the highest probability or uses beam search for more complex decoding.
