Integer factorization is a fundamental problem in number theory and cryptography. It involves decomposing a composite number into a product of smaller integers, specifically prime numbers. This process is critical in various fields, especially in cryptography, where the security of algorithms like RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers.

---

## **Purpose of Integer Factorization**

**Integer Factorization** is the process of determining the prime numbers that multiply together to yield a given composite integer \( N \).

- **Mathematical Definition**:
  - Given a composite number \( N \), find primes \( p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k \) such that:
    $$
    N = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \dots \times p_k^{e_k}
    $$
    Where \( e_i \) are positive integers denoting the exponents of the prime factors.

**Importance in Cryptography**:

- **RSA Algorithm**: The RSA cryptosystem's security is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.
- **Discrete Logarithm Problem**: Similar computational hardness assumptions are used in other cryptographic algorithms.

---

## **Applications in Cryptography**

### **RSA Cryptosystem Overview**

    E --> F["Public Key: (e, n)"]
    E --> G["Private Key: (d, n)"]
    
```


- **Key Generation Steps**:
  1. **Select Two Large Primes**: $p$ and $q$.
  2. **Compute** $n$ : $n = p \times q$ ; $n$ becomes part of both public and private keys.
  3. **Compute Euler's Totient Function** $φ(n)$ : $φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$.
  4. **Choose Public Exponent** $e$ : $e$ such that $1 < e < φ(n)$ and $\gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1$.
  5. **Compute Private Exponent** $d$ : $d$ such that $e \times d \equiv 1 \mod φ(n)$.
  6. **Public Key**: $(e, n)$.
  7. **Private Key**: $(d, n)$.

- **Encryption and Decryption**:
  - **Encryption**: $c = m^e \mod n$
  - **Decryption**: $m = c^d \mod n$
  - Where $m$ is the plaintext and $c$ is the ciphertext.

**Security Basis**:

- **Trapdoor Function**: Multiplying two large primes is computationally easy, but factoring their product is hard.
- **Integer Factorization Problem (IFP)**: The infeasibility of factoring \( n \) to retrieve \( p \) and \( q \) ensures the security of RSA.

## **Integer Factorization Algorithms and Complexities**

### **1. Trial Division**

**Description**: Divides $N$ by all prime numbers less than or equal to $\sqrt{N}$.

- **Complexity**: $O\left( \sqrt{N} \right)$, exponential time.
- **Impractical** for large $N$.

### **2. Fermat's Factorization Method**

**Description**: Based on representing $N$ as the difference of two squares: $N = x^2 - y^2$.

- **Algorithm Steps**:
  1. Find $x$ such that $x = \lceil \sqrt{N} \rceil$.
  2. Compute $y = \sqrt{x^2 - N}$.
  3. If $y$ is an integer, factors are $(x - y)$ and $(x + y)$.

- **Complexity**: Efficient when factors are close to each other.

### **3. Pollard's Rho Algorithm**

**Description**: A probabilistic algorithm suitable for factoring large numbers.

    A["Start with function f(x) = x^2 + c mod N"] --> B[Initialize x and y to random values]
    B --> C["Loop until gcd(|x - y|, N) > 1"]

    D --> E["Update y = f(f(y))"]
    E --> C
    C --> F["Compute gcd(|x - y|, N)"]
    F --> G["If gcd ≠ 1 and gcd ≠ N, then gcd is a factor"]
    
```

- **Complexity**: $O(N^{1/4})$, faster than trial division.

### **4. Quadratic Sieve (QS)**

**Description**: An advanced algorithm effective for numbers up to 100 digits.

- **Algorithm Overview**:
  - Finds a sequence of numbers $x_i$ such that $x_i^2 \mod N$ can be factored over a small factor base.
  - Uses linear algebra to find a subset of these numbers whose product is a square modulo $N$.
  - Then, similar to Fermat's method, computes $\gcd(a - b, N)$ to find factors.

- **Complexity**: Sub-exponential time:
  $$
  O\left( \exp\left( \left( \sqrt{\ln N \ln \ln N} \right) \right) \right)
  $$

### **5. General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)**

**Description**: The most efficient classical algorithm for factoring large integers (>100 digits).

- **Algorithm Steps**:
  1. **Polynomial Selection**: Choose polynomials that have a common root modulo $N$.
  2. **Sieving Step**: Find relations (pairs of integers) that satisfy certain congruences.
  3. **Linear Algebra Step**: Solve a large sparse linear system modulo 2.
  4. **Square Root Step**: Compute square roots of large numbers modulo $N$.
  5. **Final Computation**: Use the results to find a factor of $N$.

- **Complexity**: Sub-exponential time:
  $$
  O\left( \exp\left( \left( \left( \frac{64}{9} \right)^{1/3} (\ln N)^{1/3} (\ln \ln N)^{2/3} \right) \right) \right)
  $$

## **Complexity and Computational Hardness**

- **Exponential vs. Sub-Exponential Time**:
  - **Exponential Time Algorithms**: Time complexity grows exponentially with the size of the input (number of digits in $N$).
  - **Sub-Exponential Time Algorithms**: Faster than exponential but still not polynomial time.

- **No Known Polynomial-Time Classical Algorithm**:
  - As of now, there is no classical algorithm that factors large integers in polynomial time.
