## 1. Introduction to Attention Mechanisms <a name="introduction"></a>

The attention mechanism was introduced to help neural networks focus on the most relevant parts of the input when generating a specific part of the output. Initially applied in machine translation tasks, attention has become integral to various NLP applications, including text summarization, question answering, and more.

## 2. The Need for Attention in Sequence Models <a name="need-for-attention"></a>

Traditional sequence-to-sequence models, such as those using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.

### Limitations of Traditional RNNs:

- **Fixed-length context vectors**: Encoders compress input sequences into fixed-size vectors, which can lose important information.
- **Difficulty with long sequences**: Information from earlier in the sequence can be lost or diminished.

### Attention Addresses These Issues:

- **Dynamic weighting**: Assigns different weights to different parts of the input.
- **Enhanced context representation**: Allows the model to consider all input positions when generating each output element.

## 3. Attention Mechanism Explained <a name="attention-explained"></a>

At its core, the attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the input representations, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input for each output.

### 3.1. Mathematical Formulation <a name="mathematical-formulation"></a>

Given:

- **Encoder hidden states**: $\mathbf{H} = [\mathbf{h}_1, \mathbf{h}_2, \dots, \mathbf{h}_n]$
- **Decoder hidden state** at time $t$: $\mathbf{s}_t$

The attention mechanism computes:

1. **Alignment scores** \( e_{t,i} \):

   The alignment between the decoder state \( \mathbf{s}_t \) and encoder outputs \( \mathbf{h}_i \):

   $$
   e_{t,i} = \text{score}(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{h}_i)
   $$

2. **Attention weights** \( \alpha_{t,i} \):

   Softmax over alignment scores to get probabilities:

   $$
   \alpha_{t,i} = \frac{\exp(e_{t,i})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \exp(e_{t,k})}
   $$

3. **Context vector** \( \mathbf{c}_t \):

   Weighted sum of encoder hidden states:

   $$
   \mathbf{c}_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{t,i} \mathbf{h}_i
   $$

4. **New decoder state**:

   The context vector \( \mathbf{c}_t \) is combined with the decoder's hidden state to produce the output.

---

## 4. Types of Attention Mechanisms <a name="types-of-attention"></a>

### 4.1. Additive (Bahdanau) Attention <a name="bahdanau-attention"></a>

Introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2015), additive attention uses a feedforward network to compute alignment scores.

**Alignment score function**:

$$
e_{t,i} = \mathbf{v}_a^\top \tanh\left(\mathbf{W}_a [\mathbf{s}_{t-1}; \mathbf{h}_i]\right)
$$

### 4.2. Multiplicative (Luong) Attention <a name="luong-attention"></a>

Proposed by Luong et al. (2015), multiplicative attention computes alignment scores using dot products.

**Alignment score functions**:

- **Dot product**:

  $$
  e_{t,i} = \mathbf{s}_t^\top \mathbf{h}_i
  $$

- **General**:

  $$
  e_{t,i} = \mathbf{s}_t^\top \mathbf{W}_a \mathbf{h}_i
  $$

### 4.3. Self-Attention <a name="self-attention"></a>

Self-attention computes attention weights among elements within the same sequence, allowing the model to capture dependencies without regard to their distance in the sequence.

---

## 5. Self-Attention in Transformers <a name="transformers"></a>

The Transformer architecture relies heavily on self-attention mechanisms to model relationships in the input data.

### 5.1. Query, Key, and Value Vectors <a name="qkv"></a>

Each input vector is projected into three vectors:

- **Query (\( \mathbf{Q} \))**
- **Key (\( \mathbf{K} \))**
- **Value (\( \mathbf{V} \))**

### 5.2. Scaled Dot-Product Attention <a name="scaled-dot-product"></a>

Calculates attention scores using the query, key, and value matrices.

**Formula**:

$$
\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \mathbf{V}
$$

- \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors.

        Softmax --> WeightedSum
        V -.-> WeightedSum
        WeightedSum --> Output
    end
  - 
```

### 5.3. Multi-Head Attention <a name="multi-head-attention"></a>

Instead of performing a single attention function, the model splits the queries, keys, and values into multiple heads, allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces.

**Formula**:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{MultiHead}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) &= \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_h) \mathbf{W}^O \\
\text{where} \quad \text{head}_i &= \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{W}_i^Q, \mathbf{K} \mathbf{W}_i^K, \mathbf{V} \mathbf{W}_i^V)
\end{align*}
$$

    LinearO --> Output
```

## 6. Positional Encoding <a name="positional-encoding"></a>

Since the Transformer model contains no recurrence or convolution, positional encoding is added to provide information about the position of each token.

**Formula**:

For each position \( pos \) and dimension \( i \):

- **Sinusoidal Functions**:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  PE_{(pos, 2i)} &= \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right) \\
  PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} &= \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
  \end{align*}
  $$

## 7. Visualization of Attention <a name="visualization"></a>

Attention mechanisms can be visualized to show how the model focuses on different parts of the input.

**Mermaid Diagram Example**:

```mermaid

    A1([Token 1]) --> H1[Hidden State h1]
    A2([Token 2]) --> H2[Hidden State h2]

    end
    subgraph Decoder

    end
    H1 -.->|Attention Weights α1| Output
    H2 -.->|Attention Weights α2| Output
    H3 -.->|Attention Weights α3| Output
```

# Additional Details

## Deep Dive into Self-Attention

### Computation Steps

Given an input sequence of vectors $X = [\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n]$:

1. **Linear Projections**:

   Compute queries ($\mathbf{Q}$), keys ($\mathbf{K}$), and values ($\mathbf{V}$):

   $$
   \mathbf{Q} = X \mathbf{W}^Q, \quad \mathbf{K} = X \mathbf{W}^K, \quad \mathbf{V} = X \mathbf{W}^V
   $$

2. **Compute Attention Scores**:

   $$
   \text{Attention Scores} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^\top
   $$

3. **Scale Attention Scores**:

   $$
   \text{Scaled Scores} = \frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}
   $$

4. **Apply Softmax**:

   Normalize the scores to get attention weights:

   $$
   \text{Attention Weights} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)
   $$

5. **Compute Output**:

   Multiply attention weights by the value vectors:

   $$
   \text{Output} = \text{Attention Weights} \cdot \mathbf{V}
   $$

## Multi-Head Attention Details

- **Purpose**: Allows the model to focus on different positions and aspects of the input.

- **Heads**: Each head learns separate attention patterns.

- **Dimensionality**:

  If the model dimension is $d_{model}$ and there are $h$ heads, each head has a dimension of $\frac{d_{model}}{h}$.
