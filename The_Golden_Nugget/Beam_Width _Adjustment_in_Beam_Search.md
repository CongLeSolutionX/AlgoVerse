## **1. Introduction to Beam Search**

Beam Search is an advanced search algorithm that explores a graph (or tree) to find a sequence of tokens that maximizes the probability of a given language model. It is a breadth-limited heuristic search that keeps track of the top \( k \) most probable sequences (hypotheses) at each time step, where \( k \) is the beam width.

### **How Beam Search Works**

At each step of sequence generation:

- **Expansion**: All possible next tokens are considered for each hypothesis.
- **Scoring**: Each new sequence is scored based on the language model's predictions.
- **Pruning**: Only the top \( k \) sequences are kept for the next step.

This process continues until the end-of-sequence token is generated or a maximum length is reached.

---

## **2. Understanding Beam Width**

### **Definition**

- **Beam Width (\( k \))**: The number of hypotheses (partial sequences) retained at each time step during the search.

### **Impact of Beam Width**

- **Smaller Beam Width**:
  - **Pros**: Less computationally intensive.
  - **Cons**: May miss high-quality sequences due to limited exploration.
- **Larger Beam Width**:
  - **Pros**: Better chance of finding optimal or higher-quality sequences.
  - **Cons**: Increased computational cost and memory usage.

---

## **3. Beam Width Adjustment**

Beam Width Adjustment involves tuning the beam width (\( k \)) to optimize the balance between computational efficiency and the quality of generated text.

### **Purpose**

- **Optimize Performance**: Adjust \( k \) to achieve acceptable output quality without unnecessary computational overhead.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure that the algorithm runs efficiently within the constraints of available computational resources.

---

## **4. Trade-offs in Beam Width Adjustment**

### **Quality vs. Computational Cost**

- **Quality Improvement**:
  - Increasing \( k \) can lead to more coherent and contextually appropriate sequences.
  - Diminishing returns: Beyond a certain point, increasing \( k \) yields minimal quality gains.

- **Computational Cost**:
  - Time Complexity: \( O(k \times V \times L) \)
    - \( V \): Vocabulary size.
    - \( L \): Sequence length.
  - Memory Usage: Proportional to \( k \times L \).

### **Overfitting and Diversity**

- **Overfitting to Likelihood**:
  - Large \( k \) may result in generic or repetitive outputs by overemphasizing high-probability words.
- **Lack of Diversity**:
  - Smaller \( k \) may produce less diverse results, potentially missing novel or creative outputs.

---

## **5. Technical Concepts and Complexities**

### **Scoring Functions**

- **Log Probability**:
  - Sum of log probabilities of the tokens in a sequence.
- **Length Normalization**:
  - Adjusts scores to prevent bias toward shorter sequences.

### **Beam Pruning Strategies**

- **NaÃ¯ve Pruning**:
  - Keep top \( k \) sequences based solely on current scores.

- **Diversity-Promoting Techniques**:
  - **Diverse Beam Search**: Encourages diversity among hypotheses.
  - **Stochastic Beam Search**: Introduces randomness into selection.

### **Handling of End Tokens**

- **Early Stopping**:
  - When a hypothesis generates an end-of-sequence token, it's added to the list of complete hypotheses.
- **Continuation vs. Termination**:
  - Decision whether to continue expanding incomplete hypotheses or terminate.

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**:
  - \( O(k \times V \times L) \)
    - Linear in beam width \( k \), vocabulary size \( V \), and sequence length \( L \).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - \( O(k \times L) \)
    - Stores \( k \) sequences, each of length \( L \).

---

## **6. Industry Practices**

### **Adaptive Beam Width**

- **Dynamic Adjustment**:
  - Start with a larger \( k \) and reduce it as the sequence progresses.
- **Heuristic-Based Adjustment**:
  - Use metrics like average score divergence to adjust \( k \).

### **Hybrid Approaches**

- **Combined with Sampling**:
  - Use beam search with stochastic elements to balance quality and diversity.
- **Top-\( k \) or Nucleus Sampling**:
  - Use alternative decoding methods for specific applications.

### **Beam Width Values**

- **Common Choices**:
  - \( k \) values between 3 and 10 are often used.
- **Task-Specific Tuning**:
  - Adjust \( k \) based on the application (e.g., translation vs. summarization).

# **Appendix: Detailed Explanations**

## **A. Beam Search Algorithm Steps**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with a single initial hypothesis consisting of the start token.
   - Set the initial score to zero or the log probability of the start token.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each hypothesis in the beam:
     - **Expansion**: Generate all possible next tokens.
     - **Scoring**: Calculate the score for each extended hypothesis.
   - **Pruning**:
     - Combine all extended hypotheses.
     - Sort based on the cumulative score.
     - Retain the top \( k \) hypotheses.

3. **Termination**:
   - Repeat the iteration until:
     - All hypotheses have generated the end-of-sequence token.
     - Maximum sequence length is reached.
   - **Selection**:
     - From completed hypotheses, select the one with the best score.

## **B. Length Normalization Techniques**

Longer sequences tend to have lower cumulative log probabilities (more negative) due to the multiplication (addition in log space) of probabilities. To address this bias:

- **Average Log Probability**:
  - Divide the cumulative log probability by the sequence length.

$$
 \text{Normalized Score} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log P(w_i | w_{<i})
$$

- **Length Penalty**:
  - Apply a penalty term to adjust the score.

$$
 \text{Score} = \frac{\log P(\mathbf{w})}{(5 + N)^\alpha / 6^\alpha}
$$

  - \( \alpha \) is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the penalty.

## **C. Diverse Beam Search**

An extension of Beam Search to promote diversity among the hypotheses:

- **Group Beams**:
  - Partition the beam into groups.
- **Diversity Penalty**:
  - Modify scores to penalize hypotheses similar to those already selected.

## **D. Beam Search Variants**

- **Stochastic Beam Search**:
  - Introduces randomness by sampling instead of always selecting the top tokens.
- **Monte Carlo Beam Search**:
  - Uses Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the value of future sequences.

# **Illustration: Beam Search Example**

### **Hypothetical Scenario**

Assume a language model with a vocabulary \( V = \{ a, b, c \} \) and we aim to generate a sequence.

### **Beam Width \( k = 2 \)**

#### **Step 1: Initialization**

- Hypotheses:
  - \( h_1 \): [\<START\>] (Score: 0)

#### **Step 2: First Iteration**

- **Expansion**:
  - \( h_1 \) extends to:
    - \( h_{1a} \): [\<START\>, a] (Score: \( s_{1a} \))
    - \( h_{1b} \): [\<START\>, b] (Score: \( s_{1b} \))
    - \( h_{1c} \): [\<START\>, c] (Score: \( s_{1c} \))

- **Scoring & Pruning**:
  - Keep top 2 based on scores.

#### **Step 3: Second Iteration**

- Hypotheses:
  - \( h_{1a} \), \( h_{1b} \)

- **Expansion**:
  - Each hypothesis extends to all possible next tokens.

- **Scoring & Pruning**:
  - Combine and keep top 2.

#### **Visualization**

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[<START>] --> h1a[<START>, a]
    Start --> h1b[<START>, b]
    h1a --> h1aa[<START>, a, a]
    h1a --> h1ab[<START>, a, b]
    h1b --> h1ba[<START>, b, a]
    h1b --> h1bb[<START>, b, b]
    %% Prune to top 2 at each step
```
