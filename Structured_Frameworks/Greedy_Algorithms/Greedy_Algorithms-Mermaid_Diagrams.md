## **Diagram 1: Flowchart of Prim's Algorithm with Time Complexities**

This flowchart outlines the steps of Prim's Algorithm and highlights the time complexities associated with each operation.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["Start: Initialize Graph with V vertices and E edges"] --> Init["Initialize min-heap with all vertices\nT = O(V)"]
    Init --> SetKey["Set key value of starting vertex s to 0\nT = O(1)"]
    SetKey --> BuildHeap["Build min-heap (priority queue) Q\nT = O(V)"]
    BuildHeap --> Loop{"Is Q not empty?"}
    Loop -- Yes --> ExtractMin["Extract vertex u with minimum key from Q\nT = O(log V)"]
    ExtractMin --> ForEach["For each neighbor v of u:"]
    ForEach --> Check["If v is in Q and weight(u,v) < key[v]"]
    Check -- Yes --> DecreaseKey["Update key[v] = weight(u,v)\nT = O(log V)"]
    DecreaseKey --> ForEach
    Check -- No --> ForEach
    ForEach --> Loop
    Loop -- No --> End["End: Minimum Spanning Tree constructed"]
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Initialization Steps:**
  - Initializing the min-heap with all vertices takes **O(V)** time.
  - Setting the key value of the starting vertex is a constant-time operation.
  - Building the initial heap from the vertices also takes **O(V)** time.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The loop runs until the heap **Q** is empty.
  - **Extract-Min** operation takes **O(log V)** time per extraction.
  - For each neighbor, the algorithm checks and potentially performs a **Decrease-Key** operation, which takes **O(log V)** time.

- **Total Time Complexity:**
  - The total time for **Extract-Min** operations is **O(V log V)**.
  - The total time for **Decrease-Key** operations is **O(E log V)**.
  - **Overall**, the time complexity is **O(E log V)** since **E** can be larger than **V**.

## **Diagram 2: Heap Operations Breakdown in Prim's Algorithm**

This diagram focuses on the contributions of different heap operations to the total time complexity of Prim's Algorithm.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Prim's Algorithm"] --> B["Heap Operations"]
    B --> C["Build Heap\nT = O(V)"]
    B --> D["Extract-Min Operations\nExecuted V times\nT = O(V log V)"]
    B --> E["Decrease-Key Operations\nExecuted â‰¤ E times\nT = O(E log V)"]
    A --> F["Total Time Complexity\nT = O(V log V + E log V) = O(E log V)"]
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Build Heap:**
  - Executed once during initialization, taking **O(V)** time.

- **Extract-Min Operations:**
  - Performed **V** times (once for each vertex), each taking **O(log V)** time.
  - Total time: **O(V log V)**.

- **Decrease-Key Operations:**
  - Performed up to **E** times (once for each edge in the worst case), each taking **O(log V)** time.
  - Total time: **O(E log V)**.

- **Total Time Complexity:**
  - Sum of all heap operation times, resulting in **O(E log V)**.

## **Diagram 3: Comparing Binary Heap and Fibonacci Heap in Prim's Algorithm**

This diagram compares how using a Binary Heap versus a Fibonacci Heap affects the time complexity of Prim's Algorithm.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start["Prim's Algorithm Implementation Choice"] --> BinaryHeap["Using Binary Heap"]
    Start --> FibonacciHeap["Using Fibonacci Heap"]

    BinaryHeap --> BH_ExtractMin["Extract-Min: O(log V)"]
    BinaryHeap --> BH_DecreaseKey["Decrease-Key: O(log V)"]
    BinaryHeap --> BH_Total["Total Time: O(E log V)"]

    FibonacciHeap --> FH_ExtractMin["Extract-Min: O(log V)"]
    FibonacciHeap --> FH_DecreaseKey["Decrease-Key: O(1) amortized"]
    FibonacciHeap --> FH_Total["Total Time: O(V log V + E)"]

    BH_Total --> Comparison["Binary Heap Total Time:\nO(E log V)"]
    FH_Total --> Comparison["Fibonacci Heap Total Time:\nO(V log V + E)"]
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Binary Heap Implementation:**
  - **Extract-Min**: **O(log V)** per operation.
  - **Decrease-Key**: **O(log V)** per operation.
  - **Total Time Complexity**: **O(E log V)**.

- **Fibonacci Heap Implementation:**
  - **Extract-Min**: **O(log V)** per operation.
  - **Decrease-Key**: **O(1)** amortized per operation.
  - **Total Time Complexity**: **O(V log V + E)**.

- **Comparison:**
  - **Binary Heap** is simpler but may be slower for graphs with a large number of edges due to the **O(E log V)** term.
  - **Fibonacci Heap** offers better theoretical performance for dense graphs because the **Decrease-Key** operation is faster.

## **Diagram 4: Huffman Coding Process and Time Complexity**

This diagram illustrates the steps of the Huffman Coding algorithm and highlights where the heap operations contribute to the overall time complexity.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["Start: List of n symbols with frequencies"] --> BuildHeap["Build Min-Heap with symbols\nT = O(n)"]
    BuildHeap --> Loop{"Is heap size > 1?"}
    Loop -- Yes --> ExtractMin1["Extract min node x\nT = O(log n)"]
    ExtractMin1 --> ExtractMin2["Extract min node y\nT = O(log n)"]
    ExtractMin2 --> CreateNode["Create new node z with frequency = x.freq + y.freq"]
    CreateNode --> InsertHeap["Insert node z back into heap\nT = O(log n)"]
    InsertHeap --> Loop
    Loop -- No --> End["End: Huffman Tree generated"]

    subgraph TimeComplexity["Total Time Complexity"]
    direction TB
    Step1["Building initial heap\nT = O(n)"]
    Step2["Total Extract-Min operations\n(n-1) iterations * 2 extracts\nT = O(n log n)"]
    Step3["Total Insert operations\n(n-1) iterations * 1 insert\nT = O(n log n)"]
    Total["Total Time: O(n log n)"]
    end
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Building the Min-Heap:**
  - Initial heap construction takes **O(n)** time.

- **Main Loop:**
  - Runs **n - 1** times until the heap reduces to a single node.
  - Each iteration involves:
    - **Two Extract-Min** operations: Each **O(log n)**.
    - **One Insert** operation: **O(log n)**.

- **Total Time Complexity:**
  - Extract-Min operations: **2(n - 1) \* O(log n) = O(n log n)**.
  - Insert operations: **(n - 1) \* O(log n) = O(n log n)**.
  - Combined with the initial heap build, the total time is **O(n log n)**.

## **Diagram 5: Summary of Heap Operations in Greedy Algorithms**

This diagram summarizes how different Greedy Algorithms utilize heap operations and their contributions to time complexity.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Greedy Algorithms] --> B[Prim's Algorithm]
    A --> C[Huffman Coding]
    A --> D[Kruskal's Algorithm]

    B --> B1["Heap Operations: Extract-Min, Decrease-Key"]
    B1 --> B2["Total Time: O(E log V) (Binary Heap)\nO(E + V log V) (Fibonacci Heap)"]

    C --> C1["Heap Operations: Extract-Min, Insert"]
    C1 --> C2["Total Time: O(n log n)"]

    D --> D1["Heap Operations: Sort Edges (can use heap)"]
    D1 --> D2["Total Time: O(E log E)"]

    B2 --> E[Time Complexity Analysis]
    C2 --> E
    D2 --> E
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Prim's Algorithm:**
  - Uses **Extract-Min** and **Decrease-Key** heap operations.
  - Time complexity depends on the heap implementation.

- **Huffman Coding:**
  - Uses **Extract-Min** and **Insert** operations.
  - Total time is **O(n log n)** due to heap operations.

- **Kruskal's Algorithm:**
  - Typically sorts edges; a heap can be used for this purpose.
  - Time complexity is **O(E log E)**.

- **Time Complexity Analysis:**
  - The efficiency of these algorithms is closely tied to the efficiency of heap operations.
  - Optimizing heap operations can lead to significant performance improvements.

## **Diagram 6: Theoretical vs. Practical Performance**

This diagram compares theoretical time complexities with practical considerations when choosing a heap implementation.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Heap Implementation Choice] --> B[Binary Heap]
    A --> C[Fibonacci Heap]
    A --> D[Pairing Heap]

    B --> B1["Simpler to implement"]
    B --> B2["Extract-Min: O(log V)"]
    B --> B3["Decrease-Key: O(log V)"]
    B --> B4["Total Time: O(E log V)"]

    C --> C1["More complex implementation"]
    C --> C2["Extract-Min: O(log V)"]
    C --> C3["Decrease-Key: O(1) amortized"]
    C --> C4["Total Time: O(V log V + E)"]

    D --> D1["Simpler than Fibonacci Heap"]
    D --> D2["Extract-Min: O(log V)"]
    D --> D3["Decrease-Key: O(log log V) average"]
    D --> D4["Total Time: Between Binary and Fibonacci Heap"]

    B4 --> E["Consider for sparse graphs"]
    C4 --> E["Consider for dense graphs"]
    D4 --> E["Good practical performance"]

    E --> F[Practical Performance Considerations]
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Binary Heap:**
  - Easier to implement.
  - Good for graphs where the number of edges **E** is not significantly larger than the number of vertices **V**.

- **Fibonacci Heap:**
  - Offers better theoretical performance due to faster **Decrease-Key**.
  - Implementation complexity is higher.
  - Benefits are more noticeable in dense graphs where **E** is large.

- **Pairing Heap:**
  - Simpler than Fibonacci Heap with good amortized performance.
  - **Decrease-Key** operation is efficient in practice.

- **Practical Performance Considerations:**
  - Sometimes the overhead of complex heap implementations doesn't translate to practical performance gains.
  - Choice of heap should consider both theoretical time complexity and practical implementation factors.
