- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Initialization:** Setting up data structures for indices, lowlink values, and stack.
  - **DFS Traversal:** Recursively visiting nodes and updating indices and lowlink values.
  - **Identifying SCCs:** Using the lowlink values to determine when a strongly connected component is found.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Time Complexity Analysis:**
  
$$
T(\text{Tarjan's Algorithm}) = O(V + E)
$$

Where:
- $V$ = Number of vertices (nodes)
- $E$ = Number of edges

### **Step 3: Explore Key Concepts - Indices and Lowlink Values**

**Objective:** Understand how indices and lowlink values are used within the algorithm to identify SCCs.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Index, Lowlink Value, Strongly Connected Component
- **Tasks:**
  - **Index Assignment:** Each node is assigned a unique index upon first visitation.
  - **Lowlink Calculation:** For each node, compute the lowest index reachable from that node, including itself and its descendants.
  - **Stack Maintenance:** Keep track of the nodes in the current DFS path.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Definitions:**
  - **Index Function:**
    
    $$
    \text{index}(v) = \text{Order in which node } v \text{ is visited}
    $$
  
  - **Lowlink Function:**
    
    $$
    \text{lowlink}(v) = \min \left\{ \text{index}(v), \min_{\forall w \in \text{Successors}(v)} \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{lowlink}(w) & \text{if } w \text{ is on the stack} \\
        \text{index}(w) & \text{if } w \text{ has not been visited}
      \end{array}
    \right\} \right\}
    $$

## **Example Mathematical Equations and Syntax**

### **Lowlink Value Calculation:**

For a node \( v \):

$$
\text{lowlink}(v) = \min \left\{ \text{index}(v), \min_{\forall w \in \text{Successors}(v)} \left\{
