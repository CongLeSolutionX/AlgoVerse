## **Research Instructions: Analyzing the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**

### **Keywords:**
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **All-Pairs Shortest Paths**
- **Graph Theory**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Negative Cycle Detection**
- **Adjacency Matrix**
- **Recurrence Relation**
- **Algorithm Optimization**
- **Big O Notation**

### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the core aspects of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, its dynamic programming approach for solving the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem, and its use in detecting negative cycles.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, All-Pairs Shortest Paths, Dynamic Programming
- **Resources:** Standard algorithm textbooks (e.g., *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al.), academic papers, and reputable online resources (e.g., [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyd-warshall-algorithm-dp-23/)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Core Recurrence Equation:**

$$
D^{(k)}[i][j] = \min\{D^{(k-1)}[i][j], \, D^{(k-1)}[i][k] + D^{(k-1)}[k][j]\}
$$

Where:
- $D^{(k)}[i][j]$ is the shortest path distance from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ using only intermediate vertices from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, k\}$.

### **Step 2: Analyze the Dynamic Programming Recurrence and Iterative Process**

**Objective:** Dissect the algorithmâ€™s step-by-step process that iteratively updates the shortest path matrix.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Dynamic Programming, Recurrence Relation, Iterative Updates
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Initialization:** Set up the distance matrix $D^{(0)}[i][j]$, where:
    
    $$
    D^{(0)}[i][j] =
      \begin{cases}
        w(i, j) & \text{if } (i, j) \text{ is an edge} \\
        0       & \text{if } i = j \\
        \infty  & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } (i, j) \text{ is not an edge}
      \end{cases}
    $$
    
  - **Iterative Update:** For $k = 1$ to $V$, update each cell according to:

    $$
    D^{(k)}[i][j] = \min\{D^{(k-1)}[i][j], \, D^{(k-1)}[i][k] + D^{(k-1)}[k][j]\}
    $$

  - **Negative Cycle Detection:** After processing all intermediate vertices, check for any vertex $i$ where $D^{(V)}[i][i] < 0$. If such a case exists, the graph contains a negative-weight cycle.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Final Shortest Paths:**

$$
D[i][j] = D^{(V)}[i][j]
$$

- **Negative Cycle Check:**

$$
\exists \, i \text{ such that } D[i][i] < 0
$$

$$

  - **Triple Nested Loop:** Each of the three loops (over $k$, $i$, and $j$) iterates over $V$ vertices.

$$
T_{\text{loops}} = O(V) \cdot O(V) \cdot O(V) = O(V^3)
$$

  - **Benchmark Against Standard Implementation:** Use test cases to assess the benefit of each optimization.

**Mathematical Focus:**

While the worst-case time complexity remains $O(V^3)$ for the standard algorithm, practical improvements may be expressed as:

$$
T_{\text{optimized}} \approx k' \cdot V^3 \quad \text{with } k' < k
$$

### **Step 8: Document Findings and Formulate Conclusions**
