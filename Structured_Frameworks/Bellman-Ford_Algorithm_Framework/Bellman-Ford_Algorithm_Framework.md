### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental aspects of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph, even when negative edge weights are present.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Shortest Path with Negative Weights
- **Resources:** Textbooks on algorithms (e.g., *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al.), academic papers, reputable online resources (e.g., [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**

$$
T_{\text{Bellman-Ford}} = O(V \cdot E)
$$

Where:
- \( V \) = Number of vertices
- \( E \) = Number of edges

### **Step 2: Analyze Algorithm Steps and Time Complexity**

**Objective:** Break down the Bellman-Ford Algorithm steps and understand their individual time complexities.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Edge Relaxation, Negative Cycles, Iterative Algorithm
- **Focus Areas:** 
  - **Initialization:** Setting initial distances.
  - **Edge Relaxation:** Repeating edge relaxation \( V - 1 \) times.
  - **Negative Cycle Detection:** Checking for negative-weight cycles.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Algorithm Steps:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Initialization:} &\quad O(V) \\
\text{Edge Relaxation:} &\quad (V - 1) \times E = O(V \cdot E) \\
\text{Negative Cycle Check:} &\quad O(E)
\end{align*}
$$

- **Total Time Complexity:**

$$
T_{\text{Bellman-Ford}} = O(V) + O(V \cdot E) + O(E) = O(V \cdot E)
$$

### **Step 3: Explore Efficient Implementations**

**Objective:** Investigate possible optimizations and improvements to the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

  - **Optimization Variants:** Study algorithms like the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Potential Time Complexity Improvements:**

While early termination can improve average-case performance, the worst-case time complexity remains $O(V \cdot E)$.

### **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:** Derive the time complexity equation mathematically to solidify understanding.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity Derivation, Big O Notation, Algorithm Analysis
- **Tasks:**
  - **Initialization:** Setting distances to infinity and predecessors to null.

    $$
    T_{\text{initialize}} = O(V)
    $$

  - **Main Loop:** Relax all edges $V - 1$ times.

    $$
    T_{\text{relaxation}} = (V - 1) \times E = O(V \cdot E)
    $$

    $$
    T_{\text{negative cycle check}} = O(E)
    $$

  - **Analyze Results:**
    - Plot $T_{\text{Bellman-Ford}}$ against $V$ and $E$.
    - Compare empirical results with theoretical predictions.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Regression Analysis:** Fit empirical data to the theoretical equation to evaluate accuracy.

    $$
    T_{\text{empirical}} \approx k \cdot V \cdot E
    $$

    Where \( k \) is a constant factor based on implementation and hardware.

### **Step 7: Explore Advanced Variations**

**Objective:** Investigate advanced algorithms related to Bellman-Ford, such as the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA).

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** SPFA, Algorithm Optimization, Improved Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Tasks:**
  - **Research SPFA:** Study how SPFA can offer performance improvements over Bellman-Ford in practice.
