### **Keywords:**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Sorting Algorithm**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**
- **In-Place Algorithm**
- **Comparison Sort**
- **Best, Average, Worst Case**
- **Big O Notation**
- **Algorithm Optimization**
- **Data Structures**

### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental aspects of the Selection Sort algorithm, including its operation, time and space complexities, and potential optimizations.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Selection Sort, In-Place Sorting, Comparison Sort
- **Resources:**
  - **Textbooks:** *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al.
  - **Online Resources:**
    - [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/)
    - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
    - [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/selection_sort_algorithm.htm)

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**

Total number of comparisons in Selection Sort:

$$
C(N) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (N - i - 1) = \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}
$$

Where:
- $C(N)$ = Total number of comparisons
- $N$ = Number of elements to sort

### **Step 2: Analyze Algorithm Operations and Their Complexities**

**Objective:** Break down each step of the Selection Sort algorithm and understand its time and space complexities.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity, Space Complexity, Algorithm Steps
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Selection Phase:** For each position $i$, find the minimum element in the unsorted portion.
  - **Swapping Phase:** Swap the found minimum element with the element at position $i$.
  - **Iterations:** Total of $N - 1$ iterations for $N$ elements.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Time Complexity Equations:**
  - **Total Comparisons:**

    $$
    C(N) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (N - i - 1) = \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}
    $$

  - **Total Swaps:**

    At most $N - 1$ swaps.

- **Time Complexity:**

  Since comparisons dominate the running time:

  $$
  T(N) = O(N^2)
  $$

- **Space Complexity:**

  Selection Sort is an in-place algorithm:

  $$
  S(N) = O(1)
  $$

### **Step 3: Explore Variations or Optimizations**

**Objective:** Investigate possible variations or optimizations to improve Selection Sort's performance or applicability.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Bidirectional Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Stability
- **Tasks:**
  - **Bidirectional Selection Sort (Double Selection Sort):**
    - Finds both the minimum and maximum elements in each pass.
    - Reduces the number of passes by half.

  - **Stability Adjustment:**
    - Modify Selection Sort to be stable by ensuring equal elements retain their original order.

  - **Relation to Heap Sort:**
    - Understand how replacing the selection process with a heap can lead to Heap Sort.
    - Heap Sort has better time complexity of $O(N \log N)$.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Optimized Time Complexity:**

  Bidirectional Selection Sort still has $O(N^2)$ time complexity but may improve practical performance.

### **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:** Derive the time complexity equations mathematically to solidify understanding.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity Derivation, Big O Notation
- **Tasks:**
  - **Count Comparisons and Swaps:**
    - For each iteration $i$, comparisons:

      $$
      C_i = N - i - 1
      $$

    - Total comparisons:

      $$
      C(N) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (N - i - 1) = \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}
      $$

  - **Establish Time Complexity:**

    Since the dominant factor is $N^2$:

    $$
    T(N) = O(N^2)
    $$

  - **Best, Average, Worst Case:**
    - **Best Case:** $T(N) = O(N^2)$
    - **Average Case:** $T(N) = O(N^2)$
    - **Worst Case:** $T(N) = O(N^2)$

    Selection Sort does not adapt to the initial order of elements.

    $$

  - **Quick Sort (Average Case):**

    $$

    $$
