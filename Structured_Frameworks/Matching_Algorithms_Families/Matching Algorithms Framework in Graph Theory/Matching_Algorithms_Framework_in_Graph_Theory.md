## **Example Mathematical Equations and Syntax**

### **Definition of Matching:**

A **matching** $M$ in a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set of edges without common vertices.

An **augmenting path** relative to matching $M$ is a path that starts and ends with unmatched vertices and alternates between edges not in $M$ and edges in $M$.

### **Hopcroft-Karp Time Complexity:**

$$
T_{\text{Hopcroft-Karp}} = O\left( \sqrt{V} \cdot E \right)
$$

### **Proof of Maximum Matching:**

Using augmenting paths, the theorem states:

- A matching $M$ is maximum if and only if there are no augmenting paths with respect to $M$.
