## Research Instructions: Analyzing Beam Search Algorithms

### **Keywords:**
- **Beam Search Algorithm**
- **Heuristic Search**
- **Time Complexity**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Heuristic Function**
- **Beam Width**
- **Pruning**
- **Big O Notation**
- **Graph Theory**
- **Algorithm Optimization**

### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental aspects of the Beam Search Algorithm and its applications in heuristic search problems.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Beam Search, Heuristic Search, Beam Width
- **Resources:** Textbooks on algorithms and artificial intelligence (e.g., *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russell and Norvig), academic papers, reputable online resources (e.g., [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [Research Papers](https://scholar.google.com)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**

$$
T(\text{BeamSearch}) = O(b \cdot w \cdot d)
$$

Where:
- $b$ = Branching factor (average number of successors per node)
- $w$ = Beam width (number of nodes kept at each level)
- $d$ = Depth of the solution

### **Step 2: Analyze Beam Width and Its Impact on Time Complexity**

**Objective:** Understand how the choice of beam width affects the performance and completeness of the Beam Search Algorithm.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Beam Width, Pruning, Trade-offs
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Beam Width ($w$):** Number of nodes expanded at each level.
  - **Trade-off Between Completeness and Efficiency:**
    - Larger $w$ increases accuracy but also increases computational cost.
    - Smaller $w$ reduces computational cost but may miss the optimal solution.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Time Complexity Equation:**

$$
T(\text{BeamSearch}) = O(b \cdot w \cdot d)
$$

- **Space Complexity Equation:**

$$
S(\text{BeamSearch}) = O(w \cdot d)
$$

- **Comparison with Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

For BFS:

$$
T(\text{BFS}) = O(b^d)
$$

Beam Search reduces complexity from exponential in $d$ to linear in $d$ by limiting the number of nodes expanded per level.

### **Step 3: Explore Heuristic Functions and Node Selection Criteria**

**Objective:** Understand how heuristic functions guide the Beam Search and how nodes are selected at each level.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Heuristic Function, Node Evaluation, Selection Criteria
- **Tasks:**
  - **Define Heuristic Function $h(n)$:** Estimate the cost from node $n$ to the goal.
  - **Node Ranking:** At each level, generate successors and rank them according to $h(n)$.
  - **Prune Nodes:** Keep the top $w$ nodes with the lowest heuristic values.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Heuristic Evaluation:**

At each level $i$, for each node $n_i$, compute:

$$
h(n_i)
$$

- **Node Selection:**

Select top $w$ nodes where $h(n_i)$ is minimized.

### **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:** Derive the time and space complexity equations mathematically to solidify understanding.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity Derivation, Space Complexity, Big O Notation
- **Tasks:**
  - **Time Complexity:**

At each depth level $d$, expand up to $w$ nodes, each generating up to $b$ successors:

$$
T(\text{BeamSearch}) = O(w \cdot b \cdot d)
$$

- **Space Complexity:**

Only $w$ nodes are stored at each level:

$$
S(\text{BeamSearch}) = O(w \cdot d)
$$
