### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Explore the Adaptive Beam Width variant of the Beam Search Algorithm, understanding how dynamically adjusting the beam width during search affects performance and solution quality.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Adaptive Beam Width, Dynamic Beam Adjustment, Beam Search Optimization
- **Resources:**
  - Textbooks on algorithms and artificial intelligence (e.g., *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russell and Norvig)
  - Academic papers on Beam Search variants
  - Reputable online resources (e.g., [Research Papers](https://scholar.google.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search))

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**

$$
T(\text{AdaptiveBeamSearch}) = O\left( \sum_{i=1}^{d} b \cdot w_i \right)
$$

Where:
- $b$ = Branching factor (average number of successors per node)
- $w_i$ = Beam width at depth level $i$
- $d$ = Maximum depth of the search

### **Step 2: Understand the Mechanism of Adaptive Beam Width**

**Objective:** Grasp how the beam width is adjusted dynamically based on certain criteria during the search process.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Dynamic Adjustment, Beam Width Criteria, Heuristic Evaluation
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify factors that influence beam width adjustment (e.g., heuristic scores, diversity of nodes, search progress).
  - Determine how and when the beam width is increased or decreased.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Beam Width Adjustment Function:**

Define a function $w_i = f(n_i)$, where $n_i$ represents nodes at depth $i$, and $f$ determines the beam width based on certain criteria.

Example:

$$
w_i = w_{\text{min}} + \left\lfloor \frac{(h_{\text{max}} - h_{\text{avg}})}{h_{\text{max}} - h_{\text{min}}} \cdot (w_{\text{max}} - w_{\text{min}}) \right\rfloor
$$

Where:
- $w_{\text{min}}$, $w_{\text{max}}$ = Minimum and maximum beam widths
- $h_{\text{max}}$, $h_{\text{min}}$ = Maximum and minimum heuristic values among nodes at depth $i$
- $h_{\text{avg}}$ = Average heuristic value at depth $i$

### **Step 3: Analyze the Impact on Time and Space Complexity**

**Objective:** Derive how dynamic beam width adjustment affects the algorithm's time and space complexity.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity Analysis, Space Complexity, Variable Beam Width
- **Tasks:**
  - Express time complexity as a summation over all depth levels.
  - Analyze worst-case and average-case scenarios.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Time Complexity:**

$$
T(\text{AdaptiveBeamSearch}) = O\left( \sum_{i=1}^{d} b \cdot w_i \right)
$$

- **Space Complexity:**

$$
S(\text{AdaptiveBeamSearch}) = O\left( \max_{i} (w_i) \cdot d \right)
$$

- **Worst-Case Scenario:**

If beam width expands to $w_{\text{max}}$ at each level:

$$
T_{\text{worst}} = O(b \cdot w_{\text{max}} \cdot d)
$$

### **Step 4: Explore Criteria for Beam Width Adjustment**

  - **Resource Allocation:**
    - Modify beam width according to available computational resources.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Heuristic Variance Calculation:**

At depth $i$:

$$
\text{Variance}(h_i) = \frac{1}{w_i} \sum_{j=1}^{w_i} (h_{ij} - h_{\text{avg}})^2
$$

- **Beam Width Adjustment Rule:**

If $\text{Variance}(h_i) > \theta$, increase $w_i$.
