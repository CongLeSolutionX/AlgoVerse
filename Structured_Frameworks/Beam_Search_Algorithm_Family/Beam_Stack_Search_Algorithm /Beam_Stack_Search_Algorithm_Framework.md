- **Time Complexity**
- **Beam Width**
- **Pruning**
- **Backtracking**
- **Big O Notation**
- **Graph Theory**
- **Algorithm Optimization**
- **Memory Efficiency**

### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental aspects of the Beam Stack Search Algorithm, its differences from standard Beam Search, and its applications in heuristic search problems.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Beam Stack Search, Heuristic Search, Beam Width, Backtracking
- **Resources:** Academic papers, textbooks on artificial intelligence and search algorithms (e.g., *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russell and Norvig), reputable online resources (e.g., [Research Papers](https://scholar.google.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search#Beam_stack_search)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Conceptual Comparison:**
  
  Understand how Beam Stack Search enhances Beam Search by incorporating backtracking to improve solution quality while maintaining efficiency.

### **Step 2: Understand the Beam Stack Search Algorithm**

**Objective:** Grasp the algorithmic steps of Beam Stack Search and how it integrates beam search with stack-based backtracking.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Algorithm Steps, Backtracking, Stack-Based Search
- **Tasks:**
  - **Algorithm Overview:**
    - Beam Stack Search is a compromise between Beam Search and Depth-First Branch and Bound.
    - It maintains multiple stacks (paths) and allows backtracking when necessary.
  - **Algorithm Steps:**
    1. Initialize the stack with the start node.
    2. At each node, generate successors.
    3. Evaluate successors using a heuristic function $h(n)$.
    4. Keep the best $w$ nodes (beam width) and push them onto the stack.
    5. If a node leads to a dead-end, backtrack to the previous node.
    6. Continue until the goal node is found or all paths are exhausted.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Heuristic Function:**

  $$
  h(n) = \text{Estimated cost from node } n \text{ to the goal}
  $$

### **Step 3: Analyze Beam Width and Backtracking Impact**

**Objective:** Understand how beam width and backtracking affect the performance and completeness of the Beam Stack Search Algorithm.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Beam Width, Backtracking, Pruning
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Beam Width ($w$):** Controls the number of nodes expanded at each level.
  - **Backtracking:** Allows the algorithm to recover from dead-ends, improving completeness compared to standard Beam Search.
  - **Trade-offs:**
    - Beam Stack Search offers better solution quality than Beam Search with moderate increase in computational effort.
    - It mitigates the risk of missing optimal solutions due to aggressive pruning.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Time Complexity Estimation:**

  $$
  T(\text{BeamStackSearch}) = O(b \cdot w \cdot d)
  $$

- **Space Complexity Estimation:**

  $$
  S(\text{BeamStackSearch}) = O(w \cdot d)
  $$

  Similar to Beam Search, but backtracking can increase the number of nodes processed.

### **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:** Derive time and space complexity equations considering backtracking and beam width.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Time Complexity Derivation, Space Complexity, Big O Notation, Backtracking Impact
- **Tasks:**
  - **Time Complexity:**
    - At each depth level $d$, expand up to $w$ nodes, each generating up to $b$ successors.
    - Backtracking can cause nodes to be revisited, but pruning limits excessive expansion.
  
  $$
  T(\text{BeamStackSearch}) \leq O(b \cdot w \cdot d \cdot k)
  $$

  Where $k$ is a factor accounting for backtracking steps.

  - **Space Complexity:**
  
  $$
  S(\text{BeamStackSearch}) = O(w \cdot d)
  $$

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Backtracking Factor ($k$):**

  $$
  1 \leq k \leq d
  $$

  - **Worst-case scenario:** If backtracking occurs frequently, $k$ approaches $d$.
  - **Best-case scenario:** Minimal backtracking, $k$ is close to 1.

### **Step 5: Explore Heuristic Functions and Node Selection Criteria**

**Objective:** Understand how heuristic functions guide Beam Stack Search and how nodes are selected and pruned.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Heuristic Function, Node Evaluation, Pruning Strategy
- **Tasks:**
  - **Define Heuristic Function $h(n)$:** Should be admissible (never overestimates the cost).
  - **Node Ranking and Pruning:**
    - At each node, evaluate successors.
    - Select top $w$ successors to continue exploring.
  - **Backtracking Criteria:**
    - When all successors lead to dead-ends or worse heuristic values, backtrack to previous node.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Selection Function:**

  $$
  \text{Select } \{ n_i \in \text{Successors} \} \text{ where } h(n_i) \text{ is minimized}, |\{ n_i \}| \leq w
  $$

  \text{Nodes Expanded } N_{\text{expanded}} &= \text{Total nodes processed} \\

  \end{align*}
  $$
