**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**
  
$$
  T(Dijkstra) = O\left( (V + E) \cdot \log V \right)
$$
  
  Where:
  - $V$ = Number of vertices
  - $E$ = Number of edges
  - $\log V$ = Time complexity of heap operations

### **Step 2: Analyze Heap Operations and Their Complexities**

  - **Decrease-Key:** $O(\log V)$ for Binary Heap and $O(1)$ amortized for Fibonacci Heap

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Heap Operation Equations:**
  
$$
 \begin{align*}
  T_{\text{insert}} &= O(V) \quad \text{(initial heap build)} \\
  T_{\text{extract-min}} &= O(V \cdot \log V) \\
  T_{\text{decrease-key}} &= O(E \cdot \log V) \quad \text{(Binary Heap)} \\
  T_{\text{decrease-key}} &= O(E) \quad \text{(Fibonacci Heap)}
  \end{align*}
$$
  
- **Total Time Complexity:**
  
$$
  T(Dijkstra) = O(V \log V) + O(E \log V) = O\left( (V + E) \cdot \log V \right)
$$

### **Step 3: Explore Different Heap Implementations**

**Objective:** Compare Binary Heaps and Fibonacci Heaps in the context of Dijkstra's Algorithm to evaluate performance benefits.

**Actions:**

$$
  \begin{align*}
  \text{Binary Heap:} \quad T(Dijkstra) &= O\left( (V + E) \cdot \log V \right) \\

    T_{\text{decrease-key total (Fibonacci Heap)}} &= E \cdot O(1) = O(E)
    \end{align*}
$$
  
  - **Combining Operations:**
    
$$
    T(Dijkstra) = O(V \log V) + O(E \log V) = O\left( (V + E) \cdot \log V \right)
