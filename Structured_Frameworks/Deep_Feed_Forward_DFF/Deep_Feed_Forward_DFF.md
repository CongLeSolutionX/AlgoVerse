### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the core principles of Deep Feed Forward (DFF) neural networks, focusing on their structure, mathematical formulation, and training process.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Deep Feed Forward, Neural Network, Layered Architecture
- **Resources:** Standard textbooks on machine learning and neural networks (e.g., *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow et al.), academic articles, and reputable online tutorials (e.g., [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), [Distill](https://distill.pub/)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Core Equation:**
  
  The computation in a single layer is often described by:
  
  $$
  \mathbf{h}^{(l)} = f\left( \mathbf{W}^{(l)} \mathbf{h}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)} \right)
  $$
  
  Where:
  - $\mathbf{h}^{(l)}$ = Activation (output) of layer $l$
  - $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ = Weight matrix for layer $l$
  - $\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$ = Bias vector for layer $l$
  - $f(\cdot)$ = Non-linear activation function
  - $\mathbf{h}^{(0)} = \mathbf{x}$ is the input vector

### **Step 2: Analyze Network Components and Their Roles**

**Objective:** Break down the constituent parts of a DFF network and understand the role and time complexity of each during both forward and backward passes.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Layers, Activation, Forward Pass, Backpropagation, Gradient Descent
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Forward Pass:** Evaluating the network with successive linear transformations and non-linear activations.
  - **Backpropagation:** Computing gradients of the loss function with respect to network parameters using the chain rule.
  - **Weight Update:** Applying gradient descent (or its variants) to adjust parameters.
  
**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Forward Pass Equation (for L layers):**
  
  $$
  \hat{\mathbf{y}} = f^{(L)}\left( \mathbf{W}^{(L)} \cdot f^{(L-1)}\left( \cdots f^{(1)}\left( \mathbf{W}^{(1)} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}^{(1)} \right) \cdots + \mathbf{b}^{(L-1)} \right) + \mathbf{b}^{(L)} \right)
  $$
  
- **Loss Function:**
  
  A common choice is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression:
  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}(\hat{\mathbf{y}}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\| \hat{\mathbf{y}}_i - \mathbf{y}_i \right\|^2
  $$

### **Step 3: Explore Activation and Loss Functions**

**Objective:** Investigate the various activation functions and loss functions used within DFF networks, and their impact on network performance and training dynamics.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Activation Function, Loss Function, Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax, Cross-Entropy
- **Tasks:**
  - **Activation Functions:** Evaluate different functions such as sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU, including their properties (saturation, computational complexity).
  - **Loss Functions:** Compare options like Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.
  
**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Sigmoid Activation:**
  
  $$
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}
  $$
  
- **ReLU Activation:**
  
  $$
  \text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)
  $$
  
- **Softmax Function (for outputs of classification networks):**
  
  $$
  \text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
  $$
  
- **Cross-Entropy Loss:**
  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}(\hat{\mathbf{y}}, \mathbf{y}) = -\sum_{i} y_i \log \hat{y}_i
  $$

### **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:** Build a solid theoretical understanding of the learning process in DFF networks including convergence behavior, optimization challenges, and the role of network depth in generalization.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Backpropagation, Gradient Descent, Convergence, Overfitting, Regularization
- **Tasks:**
  - **Forward Pass Complexity:** Estimate the cost as a function of the number of layers $L$ and dimension of hidden units.
    
    $$
    T_{\text{forward}} = O\left( L \cdot d^2 \right)
    $$
    
    Where $d$ represents the size (number of neurons) per layer.
  
  - **Backpropagation Complexity:** Similar order as the forward pass:
    
    $$
    T_{\text{backward}} = O\left( L \cdot d^2 \right)
    $$
  
  - **Gradient Descent Update:**
    
    Update rule for each weight parameter:
    
    $$
    \mathbf{W}^{(l)} \leftarrow \mathbf{W}^{(l)} - \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{(l)}}
    $$
    
    Where $\eta$ is the learning rate.
    
  - **Regularization Techniques:** Introduce methods such as L2 regularization (weight decay) to mitigate overfitting:
    
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \mathcal{L} + \lambda \sum_{l} \left\| \mathbf{W}^{(l)} \right\|^2
    $$

      $$
      
      Where $k$ absorbs constant factors due to implementation and hardware.

    \hat{x}^{(l)} = \frac{x^{(l)} - \mu^{(l)}}{\sqrt{\sigma^{(l)2} + \epsilon}}
    $$
