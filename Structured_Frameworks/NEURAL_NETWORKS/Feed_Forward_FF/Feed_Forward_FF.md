- **Loss Function**
- **Layer-wise Computation**
- **Matrix Multiplication**
- **Nonlinear Transformation**
- **Gradient Descent**

- **Computational Complexity**

### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:**  
Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Feed Forward (FF) algorithm as used in neural networks. This includes its mathematical operations, how data flows from input to output, and its computational properties.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Feed Forward Neural Network, Forward Propagation, Activation Function  
- **Resources:** Foundational textbooks in neural networks (e.g., *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow et al.), scholarly articles, and reputable online resources (e.g., [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Equation to Explore:**

  $$
  \mathbf{a}^{(l)} = f\!\left( \mathbf{W}^{(l)}\,\mathbf{a}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)} \right)
  $$

  Where:
  - $\mathbf{a}^{(l)}$ = Activation vector of layer $l$
  - $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ = Weight matrix connecting layer $l-1$ to layer $l$
  - $\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$ = Bias vector for layer $l$
  - $f(\cdot)$ = Nonlinear activation function (e.g. Sigmoid, ReLU)
  - $\mathbf{a}^{(0)}$ = Input feature vector

### **Step 2: Analyze Feed Forward Operations and Their Complexities**

**Objective:**  
Dissect the forward propagation process and analyze the associated computational complexities, especially as they relate to matrix multiplications and activation function evaluations.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Matrix Multiplication, Activation Function, Layer-wise Computation
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Input Transformation:** Linear combination $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\,\mathbf{a}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)}$ has a computational cost typically proportional to $O(n_{l} \cdot n_{l-1})$ per layer.
  - **Activation Evaluation:** Applying $f(\cdot)$ adds an additional $O(n_{l})$ cost per neuron.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Per-Layer Computational Cost:**

  $$
  T_{\text{layer}} = O\!\left( n_{l} \cdot n_{l-1} \right) + O\!\left( n_{l} \right)
  $$

- **Total Time Complexity for \( L \) Layers (assuming similar dimensions):**

  $$
  T(FF) \approx O\!\left( L \cdot n^2 \right)
  $$

  Where $n$ represents the number of neurons per layer (this is approximate and depends on the network architecture).

### **Step 3: Explore Different Activation Functions**

**Objective:**  
Examine how various activation functions influence the behavior and performance of the Feed Forward process.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Softmax
- **Tasks:**
  - **Sigmoid Activation:**

    $$
    f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
    $$

  - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**

    $$
    f(z) = \max(0, z)
    $$

  - **Tanh Activation:**

    $$
    f(z) = \tanh(z)
    $$

  - **Softmax Activation (for output layer in multi-class classification):**

    $$
    f(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
    $$

**Mathematical Focus:**
- Analyze how the choice of $f(\cdot)$ impacts convergence and the number of iterations required in learning.

### **Step 4: Conduct Theoretical Analysis**

**Objective:**  
Derive and understand the underlying equations of the Feed Forward algorithm, and establish theoretical bounds on computational requirements and behavior.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Forward Propagation, Layer-wise Transformation, Complexity Analysis
- **Tasks:**
  - **Initialization:** Set up the input vector $\mathbf{a}^{(0)}$ and weights $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ and biases $\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$ for each layer.
  - **Layer-wise Propagation:**

    $$
    \text{For each layer } l = 1, 2, \dots, L: \quad \mathbf{a}^{(l)} = f\!\left( \mathbf{W}^{(l)}\,\mathbf{a}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)} \right)
    $$

  - **Combining Layers:**
    
    Overall, the network’s operation can be seen as a composite function:

    $$
    \mathbf{y} = f^{(L)}\!\left( \mathbf{W}^{(L)}\,f^{(L-1)}\!\left( \dots f^{(1)}\!\left( \mathbf{W}^{(1)}\,\mathbf{a}^{(0)} + \mathbf{b}^{(1)} \right) \dots + \mathbf{b}^{(L-1)} \right) + \mathbf{b}^{(L)} \right)
    $$

- **Time Complexity Equation:**
  
  Assuming $L$ layers and average dimension $n$ per layer:

  $$
  T(FF) \approx \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left[ O\!\left( n_{l} \cdot n_{l-1} \right) + O\!\left( n_{l} \right) \right] \approx O\!\left( L \cdot n^2 \right)
  $$

  $$

- **Analyze Results:**

  $$

  where $k$ is a constant based on the implementation and environment.

### **Step 7: Optimize and Explore Advanced Techniques**

**Objective:**  
Investigate advanced approaches and modifications to the standard Feed Forward algorithm that enhance learning efficiency or reduce computational overhead.

**Actions:**

    $$
    T(FF_{\text{optimized}}) = O\!\left( L_{\text{eff}} \cdot n_{\text{eff}}^2 \right)
    $$

    where $L_{\text{eff}}$ and $n_{\text{eff}}$ denote effective architecture parameters after optimization.
