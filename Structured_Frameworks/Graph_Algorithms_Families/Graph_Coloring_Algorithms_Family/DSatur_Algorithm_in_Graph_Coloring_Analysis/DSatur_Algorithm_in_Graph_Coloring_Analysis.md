  - Academic papers and journals
  - Online resources like [MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DSATURAlgorithm.html) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-coloring-dsatur-algorithm/)

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Saturation Degree ($d_s(v)$):** The number of different colors to which a vertex $v$ is adjacent.
  - **Degree of a Vertex ($d(v)$):** The number of edges incident to $v$.

- **Equation to Explore:**

$$
\text{At each step, select the vertex } v \text{ with the highest } d_s(v) \text{ (break ties using } d(v) \text{)}
$$

### **Step 2: Understand the DSatur Algorithm**

**Objective:** Comprehend the step-by-step process of the DSatur Algorithm and how it differs from other graph coloring methods.

**Actions:**
- **Review Algorithm Steps:**
  1. Initialize saturation degrees $d_s(v) = 0$ for all vertices.
  2. Assign colors starting with the vertex having the highest degree $d(v)$.
  3. Update saturation degrees of adjacent vertices after each coloring.
  4. At each iteration, select the uncolored vertex with the highest saturation degree.
     - If there's a tie, choose the vertex with the highest degree $d(v)$.
  5. Assign the smallest feasible color to the selected vertex.
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all vertices are colored.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```markdown
Initialize all vertices as uncolored.
While there are uncolored vertices:
    Select the uncolored vertex v with the highest saturation degree d_s(v).
    If tie, select the one with highest degree d(v).
    Assign to v the smallest color not used by its neighbors.
    Update d_s(u) for all uncolored neighbors u of v.
```
