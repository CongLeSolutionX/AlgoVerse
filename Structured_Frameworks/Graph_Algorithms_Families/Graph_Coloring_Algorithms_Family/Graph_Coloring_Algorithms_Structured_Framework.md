### **Step 1: Define the Research Scope**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental concepts of graph coloring, the algorithms used for coloring graphs, and their computational complexities.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Graph Coloring, Chromatic Number, Coloring Algorithms
- **Resources:** Textbooks on algorithms and graph theory (e.g., *Graph Theory* by Reinhard Diestel), academic papers, reputable online resources (e.g., [MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphColoring.html), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-coloring-applications/)).

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Key Definitions:**
  - **Chromatic Number ($\chi(G)$):** The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph $G$ such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
- **Equation to Explore:**

$$
\chi(G) = \min \{ k \mid \text{there exists a } k\text{-coloring of } G \}
$$

### **Step 2: Analyze Basic Coloring Algorithms and Their Complexities**

**Objective:** Examine simple graph coloring algorithms to understand their methodologies and computational costs.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Greedy Coloring, Welsh-Powell Algorithm
- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Greedy Coloring Algorithm:** Assign colors to vertices sequentially, choosing the smallest available color.
  - **Time Complexity:** Typically $O(V + E)$ for adjacency list representations, where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Algorithm Steps:**
  1. **Order the vertices**: $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$.
  2. **For** each vertex $v_i$:
     - Assign the smallest color not used by its neighbors.

- **Time Complexity Analysis:**

$$
T_{\text{greedy}} = O(V + E)
$$

- **Greedy Algorithm Limitations:** The coloring obtained may not use the minimum number of colors (i.e., may not equal $\chi(G)$).

### **Step 3: Explore Exact Coloring Algorithms**

**Objective:** Investigate algorithms that find the chromatic number of a graph, often through exhaustive search methods.

**Actions:**
- **Keywords:** Backtracking, Recursive Algorithms, Branch and Bound
- **Tasks:**
  - **Backtracking Algorithm:**
    - Try all possible color assignments using $k$ colors.
    - If a valid coloring is found, $\chi(G) \leq k$.

**Mathematical Focus:**
- **Time Complexity:**
  - The problem is **NP-Complete**, and the time complexity is exponential in the number of vertices.

$$
T_{\text{backtracking}} = O(k^V)
$$
