For a minimization problem, an algorithm $A$ has an approximation ratio $\rho(n)$ if for all inputs of size $n$:

$$
\frac{C_A(I)}{C_{\text{opt}}(I)} \leq \rho(n)
$$

Where:
- $C_A(I)$ = Cost (number of colors) of the solution found by algorithm $A$ on instance $I$.
- $C_{\text{opt}}(I)$ = Optimal cost for instance $I$.

### **Step 3: Explore Known Approximation Algorithms for Graph Coloring**
