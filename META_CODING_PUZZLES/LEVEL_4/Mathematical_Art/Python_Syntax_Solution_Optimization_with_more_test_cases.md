Here are 30+ test cases designed to thoroughly test the Python code, focusing on performance, edge cases, and potential bottlenecks. 

I've categorized them for clarity and included explanations of what each category is testing. The goal is to cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple to complex, to identify any remaining performance issues or logical errors.


This comprehensive suite of test cases helps ensure that the code is correct, efficient, and handles all edge cases. Running these tests will help identify any remaining performance bottlenecks or logical errors. If all tests pass, it provides strong evidence that the solution is robust.

Key improvements and explanations of the test cases:

*   **Categorization:** The test cases are grouped into categories to make it clear what aspect of the code is being tested. This helps in debugging if a particular category fails.
*   **Basic Cases:** Includes the examples from the problem description.
*   **No Plus Signs:** Cases where no plus signs should be formed, including scenarios with large `L` values and different directions.
*   **Single Plus Sign:** Cases that form exactly one plus sign, with variations in line lengths and positions.
*   **Multiple Plus Signs:** Cases forming more than one plus sign.
*   **Overlapping Lines:** Tests how the code handles overlapping lines, which should *not* affect the plus sign count.
*   **Large `L` Values:**  Includes cases with `L` values up to the maximum allowed (1,000,000,000) to stress-test the performance.
*   **Zig-Zag Patterns:** Tests the logic for handling intersections when lines change direction frequently.
*   **Edge Cases:** Covers the minimum `N` value and simple scenarios with only two line segments.
*   **Dense Grid:**  Creates scenarios with many intersections to check the efficiency of the intersection checking logic.
* **Long Lines with Few Intersections:** Tests whether long lines are causing performance issues.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test cases cover various combinations of directions, lengths, and potential intersection scenarios.
