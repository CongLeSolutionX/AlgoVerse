## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific algorithm. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **README.md**: A detailed framework analyzing the algorithm step by step, including conceptual explanations, mathematical analysis, and pseudocode.  This documentation is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- **Code Implementations**: Source code files implementing the algorithm, possibly in multiple languages (e.g., Python, Swift).  Code files are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
- **Resources**: Additional materials such as datasets, diagrams, or supplementary notes, also licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
