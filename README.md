## About the Project

Algorithms are the essence of computer science, underlying every application and system. **AlgoVerse** aims to demystify algorithms by providing:

- **Structured Frameworks**: Step-by-step research instructions for analyzing algorithms.
- **Mathematical Analyses**: Detailed breakdowns of time and space complexities.
- **Implementations**: Sample code in various programming languages.
- **Educational Resources**: References and resources for further reading.

The goal is to serve as a central hub for understanding, teaching, and researching algorithms across different domains, promoting open education and collaborative learning in computer science.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific algorithm. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **README.md**: A detailed framework analyzing the algorithm step by step, including conceptual explanations, mathematical analysis, and pseudocode.  This documentation is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- **Code Implementations**: Source code files implementing the algorithm, possibly in multiple languages (e.g., Python, Swift).  Code files are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
- **Resources**: Additional materials such as datasets, diagrams, or supplementary notes, also licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Usage

### Exploring Algorithm Frameworks

1. **Navigate**: Go to the folder of the algorithm you're interested in (e.g., `AlgoVerse/Sorting-Algorithms/Selection-Sort-Algorithm-Framework/`).
2. **Read the README.md**: This file contains the structured framework, including research steps, conceptual explanations, mathematical analyses, and pseudocode.
3. **Review Code Implementations**: Study the provided code files to see the algorithm in action in different programming languages.
4. **Experiment**: Modify and run the code, or adapt the frameworks for your own research or educational purposes, remembering to adhere to the licensing terms.
