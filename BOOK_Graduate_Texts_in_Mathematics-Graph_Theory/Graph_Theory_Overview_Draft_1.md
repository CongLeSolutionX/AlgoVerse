**Explanation of the Diagram**

*   **Purpose:** To capture the main concepts, organization, and style of the "Graph Theory" textbook.
*   **Nodes:** Main topics are represented, broken down into subtopics and speciﬁc areas of focus.
*   **Subgraphs:** Organize related concepts for visual clarity.
*   **Arrows:** Show the relationships and dependencies between the topics.
*   **Style:** Utilizes different colors to differentiate main perspectives (e.g., content focus, developer focus).
*   **Note:** Each subgraph is tagged with ":::detail" to provide more granular information.
*   **Emphasis of Key elements**: Some important elements are put with specific styles to emphasize their relevance.
